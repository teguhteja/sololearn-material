# Unique 
The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.

A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint.

True or False: A primary key constraint automatically ensures uniqueness.

False
True

Unique 
Let's make the lastname column of our Customers unique:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Customers
ADD UNIQUE (lastname)

```

Drag & drop to make the 'address' column unique.

## Unique 
Now when we try to insert a Customer with a lastname that is already present in the table, we will get an error:


```sql
INSERT INTO Customers (firstname, lastname, city, age)
VALUES
('demo', 'Anderson', 'London', 24);

SELECT * FROM Customers;

```

True or False: You can have multiple NULL values in a unique column.

False
True

## Summary 
Let's summarze what we have learned about keys:

The Primary key uniquely identifies each record of a table. It is usually set as an auto increment integer.

Foreign keys are used to create relationships between tables. They refer to the primary key in other tables.

A table can have multiple foreign keys, but only one single primary key.

The UNIQUE constraint is used to make values in a column unique.
