# 4. From Ideas to Reality

The **Creativity Diamond Framework** is a structured approach to creative problem-solving that encourages both **divergent** and **convergent thinking**.

### Match the Type of Thinking with Its Purpose
- **Divergent**:  
   Focuses on generating a wide range of possible ideas. This phase is open-ended, where all suggestions are welcome, without critique or judgment.
- **Convergent**:  
   Focuses on narrowing down options by evaluating, assessing, and selecting the most feasible ideas.

### The Phase that Requires an Open Mind and an Environment Where All Suggestions Are Welcome Is...
- **The divergent phase**.

### Evaluation in the Creative Process

**Evaluation** is the third stage in the creative process. In this stage, a list of ideas is assessed, ranked, and shortlisted, ensuring they are relevant and feasible. 

**AI** can help select ideas and establish evaluation criteria.
