## The Origins of DNS

Let’s consider the example of a mobile phone where each user is associated with a unique number. Initially, we may memorize a few phone numbers, but as our contacts grow, we use a phone book to keep track of them. This allows us to refer to the phone book when we need to make a call.

Similarly, computers are uniquely identified by **IP addresses**—for example, `104.18.2.119`. IP addresses are used to visit websites hosted on machines. However, since humans cannot easily remember IP addresses, we need a phone book-like repository to maintain mappings of domain names to IP addresses. In this chapter, we’ll see how DNS serves as the Internet’s phone book.

## What is DNS?

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is the Internet’s naming service that maps human-friendly domain names to machine-readable IP addresses. This service is transparent to users. When a user enters a domain name in the browser, the browser translates the domain name to an IP address by querying the DNS infrastructure. Once the desired IP address is obtained, the user’s request is forwarded to the destination web server.

The following slides illustrate the high-level flow of how DNS works:

1. The user requests to visit a website by entering its URL in the browser.

The entire operation is performed very quickly, resulting in minimal delay for the end user. We’ll also discuss how browsers cache frequently used mappings for later use in the next lesson.

## Important Details

Let’s highlight some important details about DNS, some of which we’ll cover in the next lesson:

- **Name Servers**: It's essential to understand that DNS isn’t a single server; it’s a complete infrastructure with numerous servers. DNS servers that respond to users’ queries are called **name servers**.

- **Resource Records**: The DNS database stores domain name to IP address mappings in the form of **Resource Records (RR)**. An RR is the smallest unit of information that users request from name servers. There are different types of RRs, and the table below describes some common types:

### Common Types of Resource Records

| Type  | Description                                              | Name          | Value            | Example (Type, Name, Value)                        |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| A     | Provides the hostname to IP address mapping              | Hostname      | IP address       | (A, relay1.main.educative.io, 104.18.2.119)        |
| NS    | Provides the hostname that is the authoritative DNS      | Domain name   | Hostname         | (NS, educative.io, dns.educative.io)                |
| CNAME | Provides the mapping from alias to canonical hostname     | Hostname      | Canonical name   | (CNAME, educative.io, server1.primary.educative.io) |
| MX    | Provides the mapping of mail server from alias to canonical hostname | Hostname | Canonical name   | (MX, mail.educative.io, mailserver1.backup.educative.io) |

- **Caching**: DNS uses caching at various layers to reduce request latency for users. Caching significantly decreases the burden on DNS infrastructure by catering to queries from the entire Internet.

- **Hierarchy**: DNS name servers are structured hierarchically. This hierarchical organization allows DNS to be highly scalable, accommodating its increasing size and query load. In the next lesson, we’ll explore how a tree-like structure is employed to manage the entire DNS database.
