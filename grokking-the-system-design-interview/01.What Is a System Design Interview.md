## What Is a System Design Interview?

A System Design interview is a technical evaluation of a candidate’s ability to build robust and scalable systems. Unlike coding interviews, which typically have a single solution, System Design interviews are open to discussion and involve **multiple possible solutions** that can be iterated.

For many software engineers, System Design questions can be intimidating. Most engineers haven't worked on large-scale systems before, so explaining how to design one can seem daunting. Since System Design questions are often **open-ended**, it can be challenging to know the best way to prepare.

However, through experience with hundreds of System Design interviews, I’ve learned that there are **effective strategies** to approach these questions. With the right preparation and mindset, you can confidently tackle any System Design question.

## Key Considerations in System Design Interviews

System Design questions test both technical knowledge and problem-solving skills. Interviewers look for your ability to:
- **Understand the problem**
- **Break it down**
- **Make trade-offs**
  
It’s not just about the technical details; it's about understanding the process.

## Author’s Background in System Design

Hi, I’m Fahim ul Haq, co-founder of Educative and co-author of this course. In April 2008, I joined a team at Microsoft working on a large-scale project to build a distributed storage solution. By 2010, that project became **Microsoft Azure**.

During my time at Microsoft and Facebook, I participated in **hundreds of System Design interviews** as both an interviewee and interviewer, and I learned key strategies for mastering this process.

## What I Learned Through Hundreds of System Design Interviews

Two key takeaways from my experience:
1. **Learn the fundamentals of distributed systems** and apply them to real-world problems.
2. **Evaluate candidates’ design approach** and problem-solving abilities.

Interestingly, companies don’t necessarily expect candidates to have extensive experience with large-scale systems. Instead, they look for candidates who can **apply their knowledge** effectively in a design interview.

## How Do System Design Interviews Differ From Other Interviews?

Unlike coding interviews, System Design interviews operate at a higher level of abstraction. They require:
- Identifying **requirements**
- Mapping them onto **computational components**
- Explaining how these components fit together

The **process** is more important than the final solution. Good candidates will guide the interviewer through their thought process, showing how they handle complex design problems.

## How Do We Tackle a Design Question?

Design questions are often vague to mimic real-world problems. Here are the best practices for tackling them:
1. **Clarify the requirements** by asking the right questions.
2. **Scope the problem** to make sure it’s manageable within the interview time (35-40 minutes).
3. **Communicate with the interviewer** throughout the process, explaining your thought process.
4. **Present a high-level design** outlining the key components (e.g., frontend, load balancers, caches).
5. **Adjust your design** as the interviewer presents new challenges.

## Present the High-Level Design

In the System Design interview, components like frontend, data processing, and caching systems are represented as **boxes** with arrows indicating how they interact. This visual helps explain the **communication flow** and structure of the system.

## Possible Questions for Every System Design Interview

Interviewers often ask how a system should evolve as its usage grows. For example:
- What happens when the number of users increases tenfold?
- How does the system scale with increasing demands?

Interviewers may also ask why we don’t overdesign a system to handle more work than predicted.

## Design Challenges

Designing scalable systems comes with challenges:
- There’s no **single correct solution**.
- Assumptions often need to be made, and the design must account for **trade-offs**.

As designers, we must ensure the system has **fault tolerance**, because something will inevitably break. It's crucial to hide these failures from users through proper design.

## Who Is Eligible for a System Design Interview?

Traditionally, System Design interviews are given to **mid-to-senior level candidates** with at least two years of experience. However, large companies sometimes ask System Design questions to **junior candidates** as well. Learning System Design early can accelerate career growth.

## Theory and Practice

Most System Design theory comes from **distributed systems**. Key concepts include:
- **Robustness**: Maintaining operations during a crisis.
- **Scalability**: Handling increasing loads.
- **Availability**: Ensuring services are up and running.
- **Performance**: Optimizing speed and efficiency.
- **Resiliency**: Recovering from disruptions.

These terms serve as a **common language** between interviewers and candidates.

## When Does the System Design Interview Occur in the Hiring Process?

In companies like **FAANG+** (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft), the System Design interview typically comes after coding interviews and before behavioral interviews. It’s a key step in the hiring process, especially for technical roles.
