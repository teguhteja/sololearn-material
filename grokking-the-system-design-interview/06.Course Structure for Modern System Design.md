## Structure of the Course

This course consists of **forty chapters**, segmented into four sections:

### 1. **Introduction**
This section has five chapters:
- **Chapter 1**: How to prepare for a system design interview.
- **Chapter 2**: Introduction to the course and its key features.
- **Chapter 3**: Exploring different types of abstractions.
- **Chapter 4**: Essential non-functional characteristics for large-scale systems.
- **Chapter 5**: Back-of-the-envelope calculations for resource estimation in design problems.

### 2. **Building Blocks**
This section starts with an introductory lesson on **sixteen different building blocks**, each discussed in its own chapter. The final chapter in this section provides a conclusion and introduces the next section.

### 3. **Design Problems**
The core of the course features **thirteen design problems**:
- Design Google Docs
- Design Typeahead
- Design WhatsApp
- Design Web Crawler
- Design TinyURL
- Design Instagram
- Design Newsfeed System
- Design Twitter
- Design Uber
- Design Yelp
- Design Google Maps
- Design Quora
- Design YouTube

### 4. **Epilogue**
This section wraps up the course with three chapters:
- **Spectacular Failures**: Real-world examples of how small mistakes can cause large applications to fail, and how to mitigate such failures.
- **Concluding Remarks**: Summarizes the course.

## Strengths of the Course

This course fills important gaps found in other available system design courses. Below are some key strengths:

| **Strength**                           | **Advantage** |
|----------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Building Blocks**                    | Modern approach, constructing larger systems using smaller building blocks. |
| **Building Blocks as Design Problems** | Treating each building block as a stand-alone, mini design problem. |
| **Incremental Improvement to Design**  | Layer-by-layer design, addressing bottlenecks incrementally. |
| **Evaluating the Design**              | Accountability for the design, showing its performance. |
| **Solving Traditional Problems**       | Updated designs meeting modern industry demands. |
| **New Design Problems Added**          | Updates to decades-old system design problems. |
| **Careful Collection of Design Problems** | Unique aspects of problem-solving in each design challenge. |
| **Contributions from FAANG Experts**   | Learn from experts in top tech companies. |
| **AI-based Quizzes and Assessments**   | Evaluate learnerâ€™s concepts of system design through AI-powered quizzes. |
