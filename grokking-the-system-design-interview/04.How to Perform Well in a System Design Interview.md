- Discuss the components
- Discuss trade-offs
- What not to do in an interview

## What to Do During the Interview
It's important to avoid appearing unoriginal. Interviewers often ask the same question to many candidates, and reproducing a generic design might not impress them. 

At the same time, interviews can be stressful. Having a strategy to approach the problem is key. Depending on the candidate, there can be multiple strategies to tackle a design problem. Here's a suggested approach:

### Strategize, Then Divide and Conquer
We recommend including the following activities in the interview:

### Ask Refining Questions
Understand the design problem and its requirements. Think like a product manager and prioritize the main features by asking the interviewer refining questions. The goal is to lead the interviewer through the reasoning behind the design. 

Ensure that you're solving the right problem by dividing requirements into two groups:
- **Direct requirements**: What the clients need, e.g., the ability to send real-time messages to friends.
- **Indirect requirements**: Factors like performance, e.g., ensuring the messaging service performs well under high user loads.

> **Note**: Professionals refer to these as **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.

### Handle Data
Identifying and understanding data is crucial for selecting appropriate data storage systems and components. Some key questions to ask:
- What's the size of the data now?
- At what rate will the data grow?
- How will the data be consumed by subsystems or end users?
- Is the data read-heavy or write-heavy?
- Do we need strict or eventual consistency?
- What are the durability targets for the data?
- What privacy or regulatory requirements must be met?

### Discuss the Components
At some level, the goal is to determine which components to use, where they'll be placed, and how they'll interact. 

For example, should you use a conventional or NoSQL database? Even if you believe NoSQL is better, the interviewer may ask for a traditional database solution. 

> **Tip**: Use abstract boxes for components and arrows to show interactions. Defining high-level APIs helps clarify system data and interaction requirements.

Components to consider include:
- Front-end components
- Load balancers
- Caches
- Databases
- Firewalls
- CDNs

### Discuss Trade-offs
Remember, there's no single correct answer to a design problem. Different candidates can present different solutions for the same problem. Here's why:
- Components have different pros and cons.
- Design choices impact both financial cost and technical complexity.
- Every design has weaknesses, and as a designer, you should be aware of them. A good approach is to have a follow-up plan for weaknesses.

For example, your design might not handle ten times the current load, but if that’s not expected in the near future, you can monitor load growth closely and plan accordingly. This is an intentional trade-off to reduce system cost.

> **Key Consideration**: Fault tolerance and security must always be integrated into the design since big systems are always at risk of failure.

## What Not to Do in a System Design Interview
Here are some things to avoid during a system design interview:
- Don’t write code during the interview.
- Don’t start building without a plan.
- Don’t work in silence.
- Don’t describe numbers without context. Always provide reasoning.
- Don’t pretend to know something if you don’t. If the interviewer asks about a system you're unfamiliar with, be honest. The interviewer may either explain it or change the question.
