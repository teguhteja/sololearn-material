### Why is it important to prepare strategically?

Strategic preparation varies depending on the company you're interviewing for. For example, an interview at **Amazon** may require a different approach than an interview at **Slack**. While the process shares similarities, each company has its nuances, making it important to tailor your interview preparation accordingly.

To succeed in a System Design interview, you need to master the following areas:

- **Fundamental concepts in System Design**
- **Fundamentals of distributed systems**
- **Architecture of large-scale web applications**
- **Design of large-scale distributed systems**

Each of these dimensions feeds into the next.

### Fundamental Concepts in System Design Interview

- **PACELC Theorem:** Extends the **CAP theorem** by addressing tradeoffs between **latency** and **consistency** in normal operations.
- **Heartbeat:** A mechanism for failure detection in distributed systems by sending periodic "heartbeat" messages.
- **AJAX Polling:** The client repeatedly polls the server for data. If no data is available, an empty response is returned.
- **HTTP Long-Polling:** The server holds the client request until data becomes available, providing a response only when necessary.
- **WebSockets:** Enables full-duplex communication, allowing both client and server to exchange data at any time.
- **Server-Sent Events (SSEs):** Establishes a long-term connection where the server pushes data to the client.

### Fundamentals of Distributed Systems

- **Data Durability and Consistency:** Handling read-write processes and preventing data corruption.
- **Replication:** Ensuring data durability and consistency across nodes by backing up and repeating processes.
- **Partitioning (Sharding):** Distributes both data and processes across multiple nodes to optimize performance.
- **Consensus:** Ensuring all nodes in a distributed system agree on data consistency and process synchronization.
- **Distributed Transactions:** Managing transactions across databases with consistency checks across nodes.

---

### The Architecture of Large-Scale Web Applications

- **N-tier Applications:** Dividing the application into layers, with processing distributed across different servers.
- **HTTP and REST:** The backbone of internet communication, essential for scalable, efficient APIs.
- **DNS and Load Balancing:** Routing traffic efficiently to ensure system stability by distributing user requests across multiple servers.
- **Caching:** Storing frequently accessed data for quick retrieval, improving performance.
- **Stream Processing:** Efficiently processing continuous data streams in real-time.

### Design of Large-Scale Distributed Systems

Once you understand distributed systems and web architecture, applying this knowledge is key. Practice designing real-world systems like **Twitter**, **Uber**, or **Instagram** to get a handle on complex system requirements.

### Summary

The world of software engineering is increasingly driven by distributed systems. **System Design interviews** are becoming a crucial component in technical interviews, especially at major tech companies. By understanding key concepts like **CAP theorem**, **data durability**, **distributed transactions**, and **web architecture**, youâ€™ll be well-equipped to tackle any challenges in System Design.
