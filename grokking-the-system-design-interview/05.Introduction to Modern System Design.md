## Understanding System Design

System design is the process of defining components, their integration, APIs, and data models to build large-scale systems that meet specific functional and non-functional requirements.

System design utilizes concepts from computer networking, parallel computing, and distributed systems to create scalable, high-performance systems. Distributed systems are scalable by nature but inherently complex. The discipline of system design helps manage this complexity and achieve desired results.

Key goals of system design include building systems that are:
- **Reliable**: Handle faults, failures, and errors.
- **Effective**: Meet user needs and business requirements.
- **Maintainable**: Flexible, scalable, and capable of evolving to accommodate new features.

## Modern System Design Using Building Blocks

We break down commonly-used design elements (e.g., load balancers) as the foundational building blocks of high-level system design. This method serves two purposes:
1. **Detailed Discussion**: It allows us to explore each building block in depth, discussing related mini-design problems.
2. **Focus on Problem-Specific Aspects**: When addressing a design problem, we can focus on unique challenges and simply mention which building blocks will be used and how they'll be utilized, eliminating repetitive discussions.

> We’ve identified 16 critical building blocks essential for modern system design.

## About This System Design Course

This course focuses on designing systems that can:
- Scale with increasing users
- Remain available even when faults occur
- Meet functional goals with good performance

In the real world, system building is an **iterative process**. We start with a solid design, measure performance, and improve in subsequent iterations.

The course emphasizes understanding the concepts behind system design, rather than providing boilerplate solutions. Here's what this course aims to achieve:

### Fresh Perspective on System Design
While many courses offer formulas for tackling design problems, this course encourages approaching problems from **first principles**. System design isn't just a formulaic process—it's both an art and a science.

### Going Deep and Broad
We tackle traditional problems with in-depth discussions and new problems focusing on scalability, availability, maintainability, consistency, and fault-tolerance. This prepares learners to handle any design challenge.

### Iterative Process
Systems improve over iterations. We often start with a simple design, identify bottlenecks, and improve. Even under time constraints, two iterations are recommended:
1. The first iteration focuses on a well-thought-out design.
2. The second iteration identifies improvements or changes based on new insights.

### Interactive Learning
This course provides opportunities to gain hands-on experience. Some problems guide learners step-by-step, while others challenge them to design systems independently. Key concepts are reinforced with questions and quizzes.
