# 2. Statements

## Statements
A line of code is called a statement. A statement performs a specific task.

The output command is an example of a statement:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Coding is an art";
}
```

### Drag and drop to complete a line of code that outputs "Game Over".

```cpp
cout << "Game Over";
```

## Semicolons
Each statement in C++ needs to end with a semicolon `;`.

The code below contains an error. Fix it by adding a semicolon `;` at the end of the statement, then run the code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Coding is your new superpower";
}
```

Errors in code are also known as bugs. Debugging is the process of finding and fixing bugs in code.

Each statement in C++ needs to end with a:

- Angle bracket `>`
- Semicolon `;`

### Translate Course
Drag and drop to write a code that runs without errors.

```cpp
cout << "Keep it up!";
```

## Outputting Text
When printing text outputs, you need to enclose the text in double quotes.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Level Completed!";
}
```

Your code will result in an error if you forget the quotes around the text.

### Drag and drop to write a code that runs without errors.

```cpp
cout << "C++ is awesome";
```

## Text vs Numbers
Computers treat text and numbers differently. You don't need quotes when outputting numbers.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << 42;
}
```

C++ is a case-sensitive language. This means that you need to pay attention to the correct input of uppercase and lowercase letters.

### Drag and drop to write code that runs without errors.

## Lesson Takeaways
