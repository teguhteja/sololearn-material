# 2. Looping Over Arrays

## Iterating Over Arrays
We can use a loop to iterate over the items of an array. 

For example, let's output all the items using a `for` loop:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    double prices[] = {5.99, 3.2, 9.99, 29.99};

    for(int x = 0; x < 4; x++) {
        cout << prices[x] << endl;
    }
}
```

In this example, we use the `x` variable of the loop as the index for the array. During each iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented and used to access the corresponding item of the array.

**Exercise:** Drag & drop to create a valid loop over the array called `names`, which stores 7 items.

```cpp
for(int x = 0; x < 7; x++) {
    cout << names[x] << endl;
}
```

## Using Loops for Calculations
We can also use loops to perform calculations with arrays.

For example, let's calculate the sum of all values in the `prices` array:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    double prices[] = {5.99, 3.2, 9.99, 29.99};

    double total = 0;
    for(int x = 0; x < 4; x++) {
        total += prices[x];
    }
    cout << total;
}
```

In this code, we declare a variable `total` to store the result and initialize it to `0`. Then, in the `for` loop, we add the value of each item in the array to `total`.

**Exercise:** Fill in the blanks to calculate the sum of the values of the array called `numbers` (an array of integers with 25 elements) using a `for` loop, and output the result:

```cpp
int sum = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
    sum += numbers[i];
}
cout << sum;
```

## For-Each Loop
To make iterating over arrays easier, C++ provides another type of loop, called the **for-each loop**. 

Hereâ€™s an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    double prices[] = {5.99, 3.2, 9.99, 29.99};

    for(double x: prices) {
        cout << x << endl;
    }
}
```

In this loop, a variable (`x` in the example) is automatically assigned to each value of the array during the loop. The colon (`:`) reads as "for each `x` in `prices`."

**Exercise:** Fill in the blanks to create a valid for-each loop, looping over the string array called `names`:

```cpp
for(string n : names) {
    cout << n << endl;
}
```

## Using the `auto` Keyword in For-Each Loops
Remember the `auto` keyword? It automatically sets the type of a variable based on the value it is assigned.

We can also use `auto` in a for-each loop:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    double prices[] = {5.99, 3.2, 9.99, 29.99};

    for(auto x: prices) {
        cout << x << endl;
    }
}
```

Now, the code will work for any type of array.

**Exercise:** What is the output of this code?

```cpp
int arr[] = {0, 2, 4, 6};
int res = 0;
for(auto x: arr) {
    if(x < 5) {
        res += x;
    }
}
cout << res;
```

The output is `6`, because `0 + 2 + 4 = 6` (only elements less than 5 are added).

## Lesson Takeaways
Now you know how to loop over arrays:

- You can use a `for` loop to iterate over an array. For example, for an array called `arr` of 5 items:

    ```cpp
    for(int x = 0; x < 5; x++) {
        // current item is arr[x]
    }
    ```

- Another way to loop over arrays is with the **for-each** loop:

    ```cpp
    for(auto x: arr) {
        // current item is x
    }
    ```

- The `auto` keyword automatically takes the type of the item's value.

In the next lesson, we will learn about **multidimensional arrays**!
