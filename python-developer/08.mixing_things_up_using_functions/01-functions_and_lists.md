# functions and lists

While developing applications, youâ€™ll often work with functions that handle various data types.

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how to use functions with lists to enhance your code's efficiency.

print("New Message")
PY
Letâ€™s do a quick recap on functions.

Identify the elements of the function


name:
argument:


print("Hello")
range(5)
type(True)
PY
Use the code to match the function with the data type of the argument it takes

print:
range:
type:

print("Price:", 39)
PY
Identify the arguments with their data types


1st argument:
2nd argument:

Complete the code to define a function

:
print("Wake up!")
print("Snooze?")

Complete the code to define a function that takes an argument

greeting(message):
print(
)

message = "Welcome"
def greeting(text):
  print(text)
PY
Call the function using the message variable as an argument

(
)

You can create a custom function that takes a list as an argument.

This code will display the entire menu on a single output line.


my_menu = ["Pizza", "Burger", "Salad"]

def show_menu(menu):
  print(menu)

show_menu(my_menu)

What does the append function do?

removes an item from a list
adds an item to a list
performs concatenation

Define a function that takes the menu and a dish as arguments and adds the dish to the menu

def add_menu(
, dish):
menu.
(


Reusability is a key strength of functions. The add_menu function from the previous example can help you create a brand new menu from scratch. To do this, first you need to create an empty list

```py
#empty list
new_menu = []

#dishes for the new menu
dish1 = "Pasta"
dish2 = "Pizza"
dish3 = "Salad"

#function definition
def add_to_menu(menu, dish):
    menu.append(dish)

#adding dish 1
add_to_menu(new_menu, dish1)
print(new_menu)

#adding dish 2
add_to_menu(new_menu, dish2)
print(new_menu)

#adding dish 3
add_to_menu(new_menu, dish3)
print(new_menu)


You can use a loop within the function body to iterate through the list argument.

Complete the function so that it displays each item from the list on a new line

def show_menu(menu):
dish
:
print(
)

You can take user inputs when calling a function.

This code prompts for user input each time the function is called, adding the entered value to the list:

```py
cart = []

def add_to_cart(cart):
  #taking user input
  product = input()
  cart.append(product)

add_to_cart(cart)
print(cart)

```

```py
cart = []
def add_to_cart(cart):
  product = input()
  product.append(cart)
```

Whatâ€™s wrong with this code?

the input function should be outside the function
the append function should be called on the list
the list is defined incorrectly

```

Complete the code to define an empty list and a function to take a user input and add the taken value to the list

scores = 
def add_score(scores):
  score = 
()
  scores.
(score)

Lesson Takeaways
Amazing job! You completed the lesson. You learned that:

 

ðŸŒŸ functions can take lists as arguments

ðŸŒŸ you can use for loops inside the a function to iterate through the list

ðŸŒŸ you can take a user input when a function is called

In the next lesson, youâ€™ll learn to define functions that work with booleans.
