# functions and booleans

In the world of programming, booleans are fundamental. They represent the simplest form of data, being true or false, and are crucial in decision-making processes within your code.

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how to effectively use functions that work with booleans.

print(10>7)
PY
First, letâ€™s start with a warm-up!

What will be the output of this code?

False
10>7
True

price = 50
print(price >= 50)
print(price < 50)
PY
Identify the values with the lines of the output

1st line:
2nd line:

Whatâ€™s the output of this code?

print(True and False)
PY
True
True and False
False

Whatâ€™s the output of this code?

print(True and False)
PY
True
True and False
False

Complete the code to return True if the value of the score variable is greater than 5 and less than 10

print(score
5
score
10)

You can define functions with boolean arguments.

For example:

S

```py
delivery = True

def to_deliver(delivery):
    if delivery == True:
        print("Enter your address")
    

to_deliver(delivery)
```


Define a function that displays Lights on if the boolean argument is True

def lights(is_occupied):
is_occupied
:
print("Lights On")



Translate course
What is the return statement used for?

to exit the program immediately
to send back a value from a function
to output a value


Translate course
Functions can return boolean values.

Complete the function to return True if the argumentâ€™s value is greater than or equal to 70

def pass(score):
if
70:

def pass(score):
  if score >= 70:
    return True

print(pass(score))
PY
What will this code output if the score is 65?

True
False
nothing/ no output


Translate course
The in operator allows you to easily check if an item is in a particular list.

 

It returns True if the item occurs one or more times in the list, and False if it doesnâ€™t.

```py
books = ['1984', 'War and Peace', 'The Great Gatsby']
book = 'Animal Farm'

def book_in_library(books, book):
  return book in books

print(book_in_library(books, book))
```


Create a function to check if a chosen subject is in a list of subjects, returning True if it is

subject_offered(subjects, chosen):
subjects

The len() function countsâ€¦

the number of lines in the code
the total sum of values in the list
the number of items in a list

True or False.
The len() function can be used to count the number of characters in a string

False
True

Define a function to return True if the list argumentâ€™s items count is higher than 5 and False otherwise

def check_count(group):
(group) > 5:
return
:
return

Define a function to return True if the passwords length is bigger than or equal to 8

def check_lenght(password):
  
 
(password) 
 8:
    
 True

 Lesson Takeaways

Great job! Youâ€™ve learned that:

 

ðŸŒŸ Functions can take booleans as arguments

ðŸŒŸ Functions can return boolean values

ðŸŒŸ You can use various tools to work with booleans inside functions
