# useful built in functions


Translate course
Python is famous for being easy to use and efficient, and it has many built-in functions that can make coding tasks easier and improve your programming skills.

In this lesson, weâ€™ll explore some of the most powerful and frequently used built-in functions.

products = ['pen', 'pencil', 'ruler']
print(len(products))
PY
Letâ€™s begin by focusing on functions for working with lists.

Whatâ€™s the output of the code above?

len(products)
4

The sum() function takes a list as an argument and adds up all the elements in a list.

Try it out:

prices = [33, 49, 55, 14]
total = sum(prices)
print(total)



Translate course
Count the total sum of the items on the list

points = [51, 47, 99, 54]
total
(
)

values = ["1", "2", "3"]
print(sum(values))
PY
The sum function can work only with lists with numerical values.

What will this code output?

123

The combination of sum() and len() is very helpful when it comes to finding an average value.

```py
prices = [33, 49, 55, 14]

#total price
total = sum(prices)
print("Total Price:", total)


#number of products
number_of_products = len(prices)
print("Count:", number_of_products)

#calculating the average
avg_price = total/number_of_products
print("Average Price:", avg_price)
```

The max() function returns the maximum value in a list.

prices = [33, 49, 55, 14]
max_price =
(
)

prices = [33, 49, 55, 14]
min_price = min(prices)
PY
The min() function returns the minimum value in a list.

What is the value of the min_price variable in the code above?

33
14
49

ages = [22, 18, 19, 35]
PY
Match the values to the functions

len(ages): 
max(ages): 
min(ages): 



Translate course
The sorted() function takes an iterable as input and returns a list with the items sorted.

ages = [25, 36, 33, 19, 56]

sorted_ages = sorted(ages)
print(sorted_ages)

Complete the code to create a sorted list from the prices list
sorted_prices
(
)

prices = [503.9, 199.9, 254.5, 39.9]
srt_prices = sorted(prices)
print(srt_prices[1])
PY

What will be the output of this code?

503.9
199.9
39.9

The sorted() function can handle both numerical and textual values. For textual values, it sorts them alphabetically.
```py
players = ["Zoe", "Liam", "Emma", "Noah", "Olivia"]
#sorting names
srt_players = sorted(players)

print(srt_players)

```

Note that the sorted() function doesn't change the original iterable; instead, it creates a new list.

You can specify ascending or descending order using the reverse argument. When reverse = True, the values are sorted in descending order.

Create a sorted list in descending order from the prices list

srt_prices =
(prices,
=
)

Complete the code to sort the values in descending order and output the three largest values

ages = [25, 36, 33, 19, 56]
s_ages = 
(ages, 
 = True)
print(s_ages[
:3])

Lesson Takeaways

Fantastic work! Here's what you've accomplished:

 

ðŸŒŸ the sum() function accepts a list as an argument and returns the sum of all its elements

ðŸŒŸ the max() and min() functions return the maximum and minimum values from a list, respectively

ðŸŒŸ the sorted() function is utilized for sorting lists in either ascending or descending order

In the next lesson, you'll learn about a new type of collection in Python.
