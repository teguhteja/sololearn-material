# Numerical Data

Numerical data is information that comes in the form of numbers.

In this lesson, you'll learn how to deal with numerical data in your computer programs.

Numerical values can be directly stored in variables.

Complete the code below:

```python
population = 1000000
```

Select the name of the variable that is storing a numerical value:

```python
book = "The Hobbit"
pages = 310
```

- pages

Numerical data shouldn't be in quotation marks. The line of code below declares a numerical variable:

```python
points = 500
```

Identify the elements of the variable:

- Variable name: `points`
- Variable value: `500`

What does the `print()` statement do?

- It displays a value on the screen

You can send a number to the screen with the `print()` statement. You just need to insert the number between the parentheses.

Complete the code:

```python
print(280)
```

You can perform math operations with numbers. Each `print()` instruction will add a value to the screen in a new line.

Run the code below to see the result of the calculations:

```python
print(7 + 3)
print(10 - 5)
print(5 * 3)
print(10 / 2)
```

What symbol is used to multiply numbers in Python?

- `*`

You can use the `print()` statement to check that the computer is following your instructions.

Both lines of code below will make the computer perform the calculation. Which one will also show the result on the screen?

```python
print(3 + 7)
3 + 7
```

- `print(3 + 7)`

A variableâ€™s name is used to identify where that information is stored. You can access the value that a variable is storing by calling its name.

When run, what will this code show on the screen?

```python
budget = 200
print(budget)
```

- `200`

How do you access the value stored in a variable?

- Calling the variable name

The fragment below is part of a prototype for a new video game. Which 2 values will this code display on the screen?

```python
username = "magician"
points = 50
lives = 3
print(username)
print(points)
```

- `magician`
- `50`

## Lesson Takeaways

Great work! You completed the lesson. You learned that:

- ðŸŒŸ Numerical values can be stored in variables.
- ðŸŒŸ You can access the value stored in a variable by calling its name.
- ðŸŒŸ Numerical data should not be surrounded by quotation marks.
