# numerical data

Numerical data is information that comes in the form of numbers.

 

In this lesson, you'll learn how to deal with numerical data in your computer programs.

Numerical values can be directly stored in variables.

Complete the code below

population

Select the name of the variable that is storing a numerical value

book = "The Hobbit"
pages = 310
PY
book
pages

Numerical data shouldn't be in quotation marks. The line of code below declares a numerical variable

points = 500
PY
Identify the elements of the variable

Variable name:
Variable value:

What does the print() statement do?

It modifies a variable
It displays a value on the screen

You can send a number to the screen with the print() statement. You just need to insert the number between the parentheses.

Complete the code

print
280

You can perform math operations with numbers. Each print() instruction will add a value to the screen in a new line.

 

Run the code below to see the result of the calculations

print(7 + 3)
print(10 - 5)
print(5 * 3)
print(10 / 2)

What symbol is used to multiply numbers in Python?

*
:
X

You can use the print() statement to check that the computer is following your instructions.

 

Both lines of code below will make the computer perform the calculation. Which one will also show the result on the screen?

print(3 + 7)
3 + 7


A variableâ€™s name is used to identify where that information is stored. You can access the value that a variable is storing by calling its name.

When run, what will this code show on the screen?

budget = 200
print(budget)
PY
budget
200


How do you access the value stored in a variable?

Using exclamation marks
Calling the variable name


The fragment below is part of a prototype for a new video game. Which 2 values will this code display on the screen?

username = "magician"
points = 50
lives = 3
print(username)
print(points)
PY
Select all correct answers.


Lesson Takeaways
Great work! You completed the lesson. You learned that:

 

ðŸŒŸ Numerical values can be stored in variables

ðŸŒŸ You can access the value stored in a variable by calling its name

ðŸŒŸ Numerical data should not be surrounded by quotation marks
