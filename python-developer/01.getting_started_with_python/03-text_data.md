# Text Data

A large amount of information out there consists of text. A piece of text data is called a string.

In this lesson, youâ€™ll work with text data.

Strings in Python need to be surrounded by quotation marks.

Create a valid Python string:

```python
"The Lord of the Rings"
```

We use quotation marks to tell Python that we are working with a piece of text data.

Strings can be stored in variables.

Complete the line of code to store the value "Apple" in the variable:

```python
company = "Apple"
```

A variable is storing a string if the value is:

- surrounded by quotation marks

In Python, both single `'` and double `"` quotes can be used to define strings. It doesnâ€™t make a difference whether you choose double or single quotation marks.

The quotation marks just need to match.

Complete the line of code:

```python
month = 'April'
```

A computer program is made of lines of code. You can add as many lines and variables to your code as you need to give the computer instructions.

Complete the code below to create two variables:

```python
movie = "Jurassic Park"
director = "Steven Spielberg"
```

The code in computer programs is made of statements. Statements are the instructions for the computer to follow. Real programs can contain thousands of statements.

What's the number of statements in this code?

```python
book = "Harry Potter"
author = "J. K. Rowling"
```

- 2

The `print()` statement is the easiest way to send a value to the screen.

```python
print("Iceland")
```

What will be the value displayed on the screen?

- Iceland

## The Code Playground

Ready to write, run, and test real code? Tap to open the Code Playground. Then hit "Run" to give the instructions to the computer.

```python
print("Welcome to the Playground")
```

## It's Coding Time!

Did you notice you could modify the code? Have some fun changing the code! Can you send a different message to the screen?

What's the instruction this code is giving to the computer?

```python
country = "Iceland"
```

- to create a variable
