# writing code
Python is one of the most popular and useful languages used to give instructions to computers.

In this course, you'll learn to write programs to automate and speed up tasks.

Python has a simple syntax which means it's easy to write, read and learn!


print("Welcome")
PY
Complete the line of code below to send a message to the screen

("Welcome")

The print() instruction is the easiest way to send a message to the screen or other display device.


print("Level Up!")
PY
Complete the line of code for a videogame

("Level Up!")



The print() instruction requires the use of parentheses around the message.

Complete the code

print
"Level Up!"



Humans use code to give instructions to machines.

Complete the code for an email app

"New email"


Complete the line of code to send the message to the screen

(
)


Make sure you use quotation marks around the text messages.

Complete the code for a music app

print(
Now playing â€¦")


It all starts with a line of code.

Complete the code for a navigation app

print
"Turn left
)


If you miss the quotation marks around the text the computer won't understand your instructions.

Complete the code for an alarm app

(
)


Complete the code for a food delivery app

print(
)


Numbers don't require quotation marks.

Complete the code to send the number to the screen

print
