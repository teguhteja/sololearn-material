# Writing Code

Python is one of the most popular and useful languages used to give instructions to computers.

In this course, you'll learn to write programs to automate and speed up tasks.

Python has a simple syntax which means it's easy to write, read, and learn!

```python
print("Welcome")
```

Complete the line of code below to send a message to the screen:

```python
print("Welcome")
```

The `print()` instruction is the easiest way to send a message to the screen or other display device.

```python
print("Level Up!")
```

Complete the line of code for a video game:

```python
print("Level Up!")
```

The `print()` instruction requires the use of parentheses around the message.

Complete the code:

```python
print("Level Up!")
```

Humans use code to give instructions to machines.

Complete the code for an email app:

```python
print("New email")
```

Complete the line of code to send the message to the screen:

```python
print("")
```

Make sure you use quotation marks around the text messages.

Complete the code for a music app:

```python
print("Now playing â€¦")
```

It all starts with a line of code.

Complete the code for a navigation app:

```python
print("Turn left")
```

If you miss the quotation marks around the text, the computer won't understand your instructions.

Complete the code for an alarm app:

```python
print("Alarm ringing")
```

Complete the code for a food delivery app:

```python
print("Food is on the way")
```

Numbers don't require quotation marks.

Complete the code to send the number to the screen:

```python
print(123)
```

## Lesson Takeaways

Amazing job! Python is widely used to build software and games, analyze data, and program Artificial Intelligence. You learned that:

- ðŸŒŸ Humans use code to give instructions to machines.
- ðŸŒŸ The `print()` instruction displays a message on the screen.

In the next lesson, you'll learn to write code to store important information.
