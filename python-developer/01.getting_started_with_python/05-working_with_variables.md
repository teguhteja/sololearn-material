Variables are key to software development. They allow you to store, label and play with data.

 

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn to work with data that has been stored in variables.

Complete the code to store the string in the variable

size

Complete the code to store the number in the variable

age

You can access the value stored in a variable by calling its name.

What will this code send to the screen?

price = 150
print(price)
PY
price
150
print

You can make calculations using the values in variables. What will this code send to the screen?

budget = 20
print(budget + 10)
PY
budget
20
30

What will this code send to the screen?

price = 5
amount = 3
print(price * amount)
PY
5
3

price

You can store the result of a calculation in a variable.

Whatâ€™s this code sending to the screen?

score = 7 + 8
print(score)
PY
15
score
7


You can create a new variable to store the result of a calculation made using other variables.

Complete the code to declare a variable named total

price = 5
amount = 6
PY
= price
amount


You can update the value stored in a variable. The variable will forget the previously stored value.

 

Run the code to check the new stored value

price = 99
price = 100
print(price)

Updating the value of a variable is called reassigning a variable.

What will this code send to the screen?

points = 35
points = 45
print(points)
PY
points
45
35
