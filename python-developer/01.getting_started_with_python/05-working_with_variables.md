# Working with Variables

Variables are key to software development. They allow you to store, label, and play with data.

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn to work with data that has been stored in variables.

Complete the code to store the string in the variable:

```python
size = "large"
```

Complete the code to store the number in the variable:

```python
age = 25
```

You can access the value stored in a variable by calling its name.

What will this code send to the screen?

```python
price = 150
print(price)
```

- `150`

You can make calculations using the values in variables. What will this code send to the screen?

```python
budget = 20
print(budget + 10)
```

- `30`

What will this code send to the screen?

```python
price = 5
amount = 3
print(price * amount)
```

- `15`

You can store the result of a calculation in a variable.

Whatâ€™s this code sending to the screen?

```python
score = 7 + 8
print(score)
```

- `15`

You can create a new variable to store the result of a calculation made using other variables.

Complete the code to declare a variable named `total`:

```python
price = 5
amount = 6
total = price * amount
```

You can update the value stored in a variable. The variable will forget the previously stored value.

Run the code to check the new stored value:

```python
price = 99
price = 100
print(price)
```

Updating the value of a variable is called reassigning a variable.

What will this code send to the screen?

```python
points = 35
points = 45
print(points)
```

- `45`

Rearrange the statements so that first the code declares the `price` variable, then declares the `discount` variable, and finally displays the discount value on the screen:

```python
price = 100
discount = 10
print(discount)
```

What values will the code send to the screen?

```python
name = "Tom"
level = 14
print(name)
level = level + 1
print(level)
```

- `Tom`
- `15`

Type to declare a variable named `credit`:

```python
credit = 200
```

## Lesson Takeaways

Great job! You learned that:

- ðŸŒŸ You can run calculations using the values stored in variables.
- ðŸŒŸ You can store the result of a calculation in a variable.
- ðŸŒŸ Updating the value of a variable is called reassigning a variable.
