# Memory and Variables

Computer programs use variables to remember important information, like items in a shopping cart, prices, and discounts.

The line of code below tells the computer to store information in a variable called `item`.

```python
item = "bike"
```

To create a variable, you just need to give it a name.

Complete the code to create a variable called `item`:

```python
item = "bike"
```

The information that you need to store is added on the right.

Complete the code to store `phone` as information in a variable called `item`.

```python
item = "phone"
```

Variables have a name and a value. They are connected with the equal sign `=`.

Complete the code to store the value `watch` in a variable named `item`:

```python
item = "watch"
```

Complete the code to store location information in a variable named `country`:

```python
country = "France"
```

You can think of a variable as a box that contains some information.

Use the image to identify the elements of the variable:

- variable name: `city`
- variable value: `"Paris"`

Create a variable that stores the user's device type:

```python
device = "iPad"
```

Humans use code to give instructions to computers, but the code will also be read by other humans (and future you!)

What would you name a variable that stores a user's account balance?

- `balance`

The line of code below tells the computer to store information in memory:

```python
message = "Level Up"
```

Identify the elements of the variable:

- variable name: `message`
- variable value: `"Level Up"`

True or False? Computers can store and recall information faster and more accurately than humans:

- `True`

Computer programs can store information like the user's progress in a video game with...

- `variables`

## Lesson Takeaways

Amazing job! You learned that:

- ðŸŒŸ Computer programs use variables to remember important information.
- ðŸŒŸ A variable has a name and a value.
- ðŸŒŸ You can create a variable by connecting the name and the value with an equal sign `=`.

In the next lesson, you'll start writing and running real code.
