# functions
In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn about functions.

Functions are reusable blocks of code for specific tasks. They help keep your code as short and easy to work with as possible, saving you from repeating code.

You have already seen (and used) functions in previous lessons. print(), input(), and type() are functions.

A function performs a task. Match the function with the task it performs

Displays on the screen:
Asks for information:
Checks the data type:


A function contains the code to perform a task. To use this code, you just need to call the function.

Complete this code to call the print function and execute the code it contains, to display the message.

("New Message")

Every function has a name. The code within a function is only executed when the function isâ€¦

sliced
commented
called

As an example, the print() function contains hundreds of lines of code with all the instructions needed to take a message, process it and display it on the screen.

Functions make the code reusable. The same function can be calledâ€¦

multiple times
only once

Functions require information to be passed in order for the task to be completed. We pass information into functions as arguments.

Pass the argument to the print() function so the task can be completed

print(
)

Arguments go inside parentheses () after the function name.

Identify the elements of the function

name:
argument:

Another function that you have already used is range().

The range() functionâ€¦

calculates the difference between two numbers
generates a sequence of numbers


Translate course
The range() function takes in a number as an argument

range(3)
PY
Select the sequence that will be generated when the range function is called with 3 as an argument

1, 2, 3, 4
0, 1, 2

range(5)
PY
Identify the elements of the above function

name:
argument:

Functions need their arguments to work. Missing arguments can result in errors.

range()
PY
This code will returnâ€¦

an error
a sequence

A function can take multiple arguments.

 

For example, we can pass multiple arguments to the print() function to display multiple values in one line.

print("Your seat:", 4)


Translate course
Select the number of arguments that are being passed to the function

print("Credit:", 98)
PY
1
2
0


Translate course
The print function can take arguments from different data types.

Identify the data types of the arguments

print("Score:", 35)
PY
1st argument:
2nd argument:


Translate course
Multiple arguments in a function are separated with a comma ,

Complete the code to display Country: Germany

print(
)

print() and range() are examples of built-in functions. Python has many built-in functions which you can re-use in your code by calling them.

What's an example of another built-in function that you have used earlier in this course?

for
elif
type()
