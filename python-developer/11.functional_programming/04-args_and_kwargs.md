# args and kwargs


Translate course
Up to this point, you've been defining functions with a fixed number of known arguments.

 

In this section, you will learn about techniques that enhance the adaptability of functions, making them more versatile and ready for different scenarios.

```py
def total(x, y, z):
  return x + y + z
```

First, let's do a warm-up exercise!

How many arguments does this function accept?

2
1
3

True or False?

When calling a function, you need to use the same number of arguments that have been defined, in the same order.

False
True

```py
def total(x, y, z):
  return x + y + z

print(total(2, 1, 3, 3))
```

When calling a function, you need to use the same number of arguments that have been defined, in the same order.

What's the output of this code?

If the number of arguments of your function is unknown and unpredictable, you can always use an iterable as an argument.

```py
def total(numbers):
  result = 0
  #iterating over the list
  for i in numbers:
    result+=i
  return result

nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

print(total(nums))
```

*args allows you to provide any number of arguments without the need to create a list before calling the function each time.

For example

```py
def total(*args):
  result = 0
  for arg in args:
    result += arg
  return result

print(total(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
print(total(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7))
print(total(1, 2, 3))
```

*args receives arguments as a tuple, which can be used inside the function.

Tuple isâ€¦

an iterable
a function
a loop

You need to use the unpacking operator * before args. This operator informs Python that the argument is an iterable and should be unpacked to receive its values as individual arguments.


```py 
def total (*args)
```


Translate course
Note that args is just a name. Youâ€™re not required to use the name args. You can choose any name that you prefer.

```py
def total(*prices):
  result = 0
  for arg in prices:
    result += arg
  return result

print(total(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
print(total(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7))
print(total(1, 2, 3))

```

Complete the function definition
```py
def display(*words):
    for item in *word:
        print(item)
```

```py
def display(*words):
  for item in words:
    print(item)
display("paper", "pen", "pencil")
```

When defining a function with both regular arguments and *args, the regular arguments must come before *args in the function definition.

```py
def show_items(category, *items):
  print("Category: " + category)
  for item in items:
    print(item)

show_items("Electronics", "Laptop", "Smartphone", "Tablet")
```

The first line of the function definition, which includes the function name and its parameters, is called function signature.

Complete the function signature
```py
def display(team, *players)
```

Python also allows you to pass keyword arguments using **kwargs. In this case, **kwargs receives arguments in the form of a dictionary, consisting of key:value pairs.

```py
#**kwargs is a dictionary
def display_info(**kwargs):
  #kwargs.items() returns the key:valie pairs
  for key, value in kwargs.items():
    print(key, ":", value)

display_info(name="Alice", age=30, city="New York")
```

The ** operator in Python is used to unpack dictionaries into arguments. It enables a function to accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments, converting these arguments into a dictionary of key:value pairs.

Complete the function signature with keyword arguments

```py
def info(**user):
```

Match the argument types with their respective operators
args : *
kwargs : **

Match the argument types with the data types they receive

*args: list  
**kwargs: dictionary

In a function definition, the order of arguments is important. First, regular arguments are listed, followed by *args for positional arguments, and finally **kwargs for keyword arguments.

Complete the function signature
```py
def show(class, *students, **info)
```

Lesson Takeaways
You're fantastic! You learned that:

 

ðŸŒŸ *args enables you to pass an arbitrary number of positional arguments to a function

ðŸŒŸ **kwargs allows you to pass keyword arguments to a function

ðŸŒŸ *args collects arguments into a tuple, while **kwargs groups them into a dictionary with key:value pairs

ðŸŒŸ 'args' and 'kwargs' are conventional names, but you can use any names you prefer for these
