# Reusing Code
Code reuse is a very important part of programming in any language. Increasing code size makes it harder to maintain.
For a large programming project to be successful, it is essential to abide by the Don't Repeat Yourself, or DRY, principle. We've already looked at one way of doing this: by using loops. In this module, we will explore two more: functions and modules.

Bad, repetitive code is said to abide by the WET principle, which stands for Write Everything Twice, or We Enjoy Typing.

Following the DRY principle makes the code:
easier to maintain
loop forever
bad and repetitive

## Functions
You've already used functions in previous lessons.
Any statement that consists of a word followed by information in parentheses is a function call.
Here are some examples that you've already seen:

```py
print("Hello world!")
range(2, 20)
str(12)
range(10, 20, 3)
```

How many arguments are in this function call?
```py
range(0, 100, 5)
```
