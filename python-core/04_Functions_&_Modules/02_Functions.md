# Functions
In addition to using pre-defined functions, you can create your own functions by using the def statement.
Here is an example of a function named my_func. It takes no arguments, and prints "spam" three times. It is defined, and then called. The statements in the function are executed only when the function is called.

```py
def my_func():
    print("spam")
    print("spam")
    print("spam")

my_func()

```

The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.


Fill in the blanks to define a function named hello:

 __ hello() _
  print("Hi!")

## Functions
You must define functions before they are called, in the same way that you must assign variables before using them.

```py
hello()

def hello():
    print("Hello world!")


```

Rearrange the code to declare a function sayHi() and call it.
