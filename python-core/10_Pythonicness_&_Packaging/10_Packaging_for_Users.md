# Packaging
The previous lesson covered packaging modules for use by other Python programmers. However, many computer users who are not programmers do not have Python installed. Therefore, it is useful to package scripts as executable files for the relevant platform, such as the Windows or Mac operating systems. This is not necessary for Linux, as most Linux users do have Python installed, and are able to run scripts as they are.

For Windows, many tools are available for converting scripts to executables. For example, py2exe, can be used to package a Python script, along with the libraries it requires, into a single executable.
PyInstaller and cx_Freeze serve the same purpose.

For Macs, use py2app, PyInstaller or cx_Freeze.

Which of these does not convert Python scripts to Windows executables?

PyExecutable
PyInstaller
py2exe
