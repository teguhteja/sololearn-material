# 19. Inheritance

## Inheritance

Inheritance is one of the most important concepts of object-oriented programming. It allows us to define a class based on another class, making it easier to create and maintain applications.

- The class whose properties are inherited by another class is called the **Base class**.
- The class which inherits the properties is called the **Derived class**.

For example, the Daughter class (derived) can be inherited from the Mother class (base). The derived class inherits all features from the base class and can have its own additional features.

### Example: IS-A Relationship
Inheritance implements the *IS-A* relationship. For example:
- A mammal **IS-A** animal.
- A dog **IS-A** mammal, hence a dog **IS-A** animal as well.

### What are the technical terms for the "Mother" and "Daughter" classes?
- **Base class (Mother)** and **Derived class (Daughter)**.

## Example: Mother and Daughter Classes

To demonstrate inheritance, let's create a `Mother` class and a `Daughter` class:

```cpp
class Mother {
 public:
  Mother() {};
  void sayHi() {
    cout << "Hi";
  }
};

class Daughter {
 public:
  Daughter() {};
};
```

The `Mother` class has a public method called `sayHi()`. The next step is to inherit the `Daughter` class from the `Mother`.

```cpp
class Daughter : public Mother {
 public:
  Daughter() {};
};
```

The **Base class** is specified using a colon and an access specifier. `public` means that all public members of the base class are public in the derived class.

## Accessing Base Class Methods

Since all public members of the `Mother` class become public members of the `Daughter` class, we can create an object of type `Daughter` and call the `sayHi()` function of the `Mother` class using the `Daughter` object:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Mother {
    public:
        Mother() {};
        void sayHi() {
            cout << "Hi";
        }
};

class Daughter: public Mother {
    public:
        Daughter() {};
};

int main() {
    Daughter d;
    d.sayHi();
}
```

### Important Notes on Inheritance
- A derived class inherits all base class methods with a few exceptions:
  - **Constructors** and **destructors**.
  - **Overloaded operators**.
  - **Friend functions**.

- A class can be derived from multiple classes by specifying the base classes in a comma-separated list:

  ```cpp
  class Daughter : public Mother, public Father {
      // derived from both Mother and Father
  };
  ```

## Example: Rectangle and Shape

To inherit the `Rectangle` class from the `Shape` class, we use a colon (`:`) followed by an access specifier (e.g., `public`) and the name of the base class (`Shape`). This allows the `Rectangle` class to access the `Shape` class's public methods, including the `draw()` method.

### Updated Code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Shape {
    public:
        void draw() {
            cout << "Drawing..." << endl;
        }
};

// Inherit Rectangle from Shape using public access
class Rectangle : public Shape {
    private:
        int width;
        int height;
    public:
        Rectangle(int w, int h): width(w), height(h) {
            cout << w << "x" << h << endl;
        }
};

int main() {
    int x, y;
    cin >> x >> y;
    
    // Create Rectangle object
    Rectangle d(x, y);
    
    // Call the draw() method
    d.draw();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Inheritance:** The `Rectangle` class is inheriting from the `Shape` class using the `public` access specifier (`class Rectangle : public Shape`). This allows `Rectangle` to use all the public methods of `Shape`, including `draw()`.

2. **Calling the `draw()` method:** After creating the `Rectangle` object `d`, we call the `draw()` method using `d.draw();`.

### Example Input:
```
5 10
```

### Example Output:
```
5x10
Drawing...
```

This demonstrates how the `Rectangle` class behaves as a `Shape`, using the base class's functionality like the `draw()` method.

### Missing Symbol to Inherit Derived from Base
```cpp
class Derived : public Base {
    // Derived class inherits from Base class
};
```
