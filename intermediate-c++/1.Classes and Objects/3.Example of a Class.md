# 3. Example of a Class

## Declaring a Class

Begin your class definition with the keyword `class`. Follow the keyword with the class name and the class body, enclosed in a set of curly braces `{}`.

The following code declares a class called `BankAccount`:

```cpp
class BankAccount {

};
```

A class definition in C++ must be followed by a semicolon `;`.

### Quiz:
Type in the keyword used to declare a class:

**Answer:**
```
class
```

## Declaring Class Members

Define all attributes and behaviors (also known as members) inside the body of the class, within the curly braces `{}`. You can also define access specifiers for these members.

- A member defined using the `public` keyword can be accessed from outside the class, as long as it's within the scope of the class object.
- Class members can also be `private` or `protected`. These access levels will be discussed in more detail later.

### Quiz:
What is the `public` keyword called?

- an accessible data
- **an access specifier**
- nothing

## Creating a Class

Let's create a class with one public method that prints out "Hi".

```cpp
class BankAccount {
  public:
    void sayHi() {
      cout << "Hi" << endl;
    }
};
```

The next step is to instantiate an object of our `BankAccount` class, in the same way we define variables of a type. The difference is that our object's type will be `BankAccount`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class BankAccount {
  public:
    void sayHi() {
      cout << "Hi" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
  BankAccount test;
  test.sayHi();
}
```

### Key Concepts:

- The object named `test` has all the members of the `BankAccount` class defined.
- Notice the dot separator (`.`) used to access and call the object's method (`sayHi()`).
- We must declare a class before using it, just as we do with functions.

### Practice Exercise:

Type in the missing parts to declare a class `MyClass`, with one public function named `someFunction`, which prints `"hi from MyClass"` to the screen:

```cpp
class MyClass {
  public:
    void someFunction() {  
      cout << "hi from MyClass" << endl;
    }
};
```
