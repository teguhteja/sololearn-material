# 5. Encapsulation

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation involves the concept of "surrounding" an entity to keep its contents together and protect it. In object-oriented programming (OOP), encapsulation goes beyond simply combining attributes and behavior within a class; it also restricts access to the internal workings of that class.

### Key Principles:
- An object only exposes what other parts of the application need to function, keeping other details hidden.
- This concept is called **data hiding**.

Encapsulation allows you to:
- Declare a function
- Hide details of a class's realization
- Control how variables are accessed or modified

### Example of Encapsulation
For instance, in a `BankAccount` class, we don't want external parts of our program to directly change the balance without using methods like `deposit()` or `withdraw()`. We should **hide the balance attribute** and ensure it is only accessible through the object's methods.

This way, the balance can't be directly changed from outside the objectâ€”only the object itself can modify it using controlled behaviors. 

This technique is known as **"black boxing"**, which refers to closing off internal parts of an object and only making selected methods and attributes public.

### Benefits of Encapsulation:
1. **Control Data Access**: You control how data is accessed or modified.
2. **Flexibility**: The code becomes more flexible and easier to modify as new requirements arise.
3. **Isolation**: You can change part of the code without affecting other areas. For example, you can change the data type of an attribute like `balance` later without breaking the rest of the program.

### Summary:
- Encapsulation ensures controlled access to an object's data and behavior.
- It allows for flexible code changes and isolates parts of the program from each other.

### Quiz:
The idea of encapsulation is (select two):
- **Control how data is accessed or modified**
- **Hide internal details from external components**
