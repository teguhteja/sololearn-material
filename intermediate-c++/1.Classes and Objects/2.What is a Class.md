# 2. What is a Class

## What is a Class?
In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), objects are created using **classes**, which are the cornerstone of OOP.

A **class** describes what the object will be but is distinct from the object itself. Essentially, a class serves as an object's **blueprint**, definition, or template.

You can use the same class to create multiple objects. For example, an architect creates a blueprint for a building, which can then be used to build multiple structures based on that blueprint. Similarly, in programming, you first define a class, and that class serves as the blueprint for creating objects.

### Key Characteristics of a Class:

- **Name**: Every class has a name, which refers to the **type** of object it will create.
- **Attributes**: Describes the properties or data that the object will have.
- **Behavior**: Describes the actions or methods the object can perform.

In programming, the term **type** refers to the class name, meaning we create an object of a particular type (class).

### Example:
If we create a class called **BankAccount**, it might have:
- **Attributes**: `accountNumber`, `balance`, `dateOpened`
- **Behavior**: `open()`, `close()`, `deposit()`

This class specifies what attributes and behaviors every **BankAccount** object should have, but it doesn't define the actual data (values). The actual objects created from the class are instances.

### Question:
In regard to classes, which statement is true?
- A class describes only the attributes of an object.
- **A class has a name and describes attributes and behavior of an object.**
- A class has no name.

---

## Methods
A **method** is another term for the behavior of a class. In simpler terms, a method is a **function** that belongs to a class. Just like functions, methods are blocks of code that can perform actions and return values.

### Question:
What is a method?
- A method is an object.
- **A method is a function declared in a class.**
- A method is the main function of the program.

## A Class Example:
If we are designing a banking program, we might define the following **class**:

- **Class Name**: `BankAccount`
- **Attributes**: `accountNumber`, `balance`, `dateOpened`
- **Behavior (Methods)**: `open()`, `close()`, `deposit()`

This class acts as the **blueprint**. Once it's defined, we can create multiple objects (instances) of the `BankAccount` class. 

Each object created from this class has its own unique data and identity but shares the same structure defined by the class.

### Instantiation:
The process of creating objects from a class is called **instantiation**. Each object created this way is an **instance** of the class.

The process of creating objects is called...
- Creation
- **Instantiation**
- Objection
