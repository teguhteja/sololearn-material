# 12. Member Initializers

## Member Initializers

Recall that constants are variables that cannot be changed, and that all `const` variables must be initialized at the time of their creation.

C++ provides a handy syntax for initializing members of the class called the member initializer list (also known as the constructor initializer list).

### Translate Course
A constant variable...
- ...cannot be changed
- ...must be initialized at the time of its creation

## Member Initializers

Consider the following class:

```cpp
class MyClass {
  public:
    MyClass(int a, int b) {
      regVar = a;
      constVar = b;
    }
  private:
    int regVar;
    const int constVar;
};
```

This class has two member variables, `regVar` and `constVar`. It also has a constructor that takes two parameters, which are used to initialize the member variables.

Running this code returns an error because one of its member variables is a constant, which cannot be assigned a value after declaration.

In cases like this one, a member initialization list can be used to assign values to the member variables:

```cpp
class MyClass {
 public:
  MyClass(int a, int b)
  : regVar(a), constVar(b)
  {
  }
 private:
  int regVar;
  const int constVar;
};
```

Note that in this syntax, the initialization list follows the constructor parameters. The list begins with a colon (`:`), and then lists each variable to be initialized, along with the value for that variable, separated by commas.

Use the syntax `variable(value)` to assign values.

The initialization list eliminates the need to place explicit assignments in the constructor body. Also, the initialization list does not end with a semicolon.

### Translate Course

You have a class `Student` with two members, "age" and "num". Fill in the blanks to initialize those members in the constructor initializer list with the corresponding values.

```cpp
Student::Student(int a, int b)
: age(a), num(b) {
}
```

## Member Initializers

Let's write the previous example using separate header and source files.

**MyClass.h**

```cpp
class MyClass {
  public:
    MyClass(int a, int b);
  private:
    int regVar;
    const int constVar;
};
```

**MyClass.cpp**

```cpp
#include "MyClass.h"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

MyClass::MyClass(int a, int b)
: regVar(a), constVar(b)
{
  cout << regVar << endl;
  cout << constVar << endl;
}
```

We have added `cout` statements in the constructor to print the values of the member variables.

Our next step is to create an object of our class in `main`, and use the constructor to assign values.

**main.cpp**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
    public:
        MyClass(int a, int b);
    private:
        int regVar;
        const int constVar;
};

MyClass::MyClass(int a, int b)
: regVar(a), constVar(b)
{
    cout << regVar << endl;
    cout << constVar << endl;
}

int main() {
    MyClass obj(42, 33);
    return 0;
}
```

The constructor is used to create the object, assigning two parameters to the member variables via the member initialization list.

### To Complete the Program:

You need to:
1. Take two integer inputs from the user.
2. Create a `TV` object using these inputs.
3. Call the `area()` method on the `TV` object to display the area.

Here is the completed program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class TV {
    public:
        TV(int h, int w) : height(h), width(w) {}
        void area() {
            cout << height * width;
        }
    private:
        int height;
        int width;
};

int main() {
    int height, width;

    // Take two integer inputs
    cout << "Enter height: ";
    cin >> height;
    cout << "Enter width: ";
    cin >> width;

    // Create a TV object using the inputs
    TV myTV(height, width);

    // Call the area() method
    myTV.area();

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling:** `cin` is used to read `height` and `width` values from the user.
- **Object Creation:** `TV myTV(height, width);` creates a `TV` object with the provided height and width.
- **Method Call:** `myTV.area();` calls the `area()` method to compute and print the area of the TV based on the given dimensions.

This program will prompt the user for the height and width of the TV, then calculate and display the area using the `area()` method.

### Drag and Drop
Drag and drop from the options below to initialize members in the constructor initializer list, and then print them out in the constructor body:

```cpp
Student::Student(int a, int b)
: age(a), num(b)
{ 
    cout << age << endl;
    cout << num << endl;
}
```

### Member Initializers

The member initialization list may be used for regular variables and must be used for constant variables.

Even in cases in which member variables are not constant, it makes good sense to use the member initializer syntax.

### A constant member variable...
- ...must be initialized in the constructor initializer list
- ...cannot be initialized wherever you want
- ...cannot be initialized in the constructor body
