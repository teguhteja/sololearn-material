# 13. Composition, Part 1

## Composition 

In the real world, complex objects are typically built using smaller, simpler objects. For example, a car is assembled using a metal frame, an engine, tires, and many other parts. This process is called **composition**.

In C++, object composition involves using classes as member variables within other classes.

This sample program demonstrates composition in action. It contains `Person` and `Birthday` classes, where each `Person` has a `Birthday` object as its member.

### Birthday Class:

```cpp
class Birthday {
public:
  Birthday(int m, int d, int y)
    : month(m), day(d), year(y)
  { 
  }
private:
  int month;
  int day;
  int year;
};
```

Our `Birthday` class has three member variables: `month`, `day`, and `year`. It also includes a constructor that initializes the members using a **member initializer list**.

The class is declared in a single file for simplicity, though you could use header and source files in a more complex setup.

### Constructor Initialization List:

To initialize the `Birthday` class members, the constructor should look like this:

```cpp
Birthday::Birthday(int m, int d, int y)
  : month(m), 
    day(d),
    year(y)
{ 
}
```

## Composition in Practice

Next, let's add a `printDate()` function to our `Birthday` class to display the date:

```cpp
class Birthday {
public:
  Birthday(int m, int d, int y)
    : month(m), day(d), year(y)
  {
  }
  
  void printDate() {
    std::cout << month << "/" << day << "/" << year << std::endl;
  }
  
private:
  int month;
  int day;
  int year;
};
```

The `printDate()` function prints the birthday in `MM/DD/YYYY` format.

### Exercise:

Drag and drop from the options below to create a class `People` with three private integer members: `birthMonth`, `birthDay`, and `birthYear`.

```cpp
class People {
public:
  People();
private:
  int birthMonth;
  int birthDay;
  int birthYear;
};
```

## Composition with Person Class

Now, we can create the `Person` class, which includes a `Birthday` class as a member:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include "Birthday.h"

class Person {
public:
  Person(std::string n, Birthday b)
    : name(n), bd(b)
  {
  }
  
private:
  std::string name;
  Birthday bd;
};
```

In this case, the `Person` class has two member variables: `name` (of type `string`) and `bd` (of type `Birthday`). The constructor initializes both of these members.

### Header File Inclusions

Ensure that the necessary header files are included in your code. For example, include `Birthday.h` for the `Birthday` class and the appropriate header for `string`.

---

## Task:

Translate the following to correctly declare the `People` class with two private members: `name` (of type `string`) and `dateOfBirth` (of type `Birthday`). Don't forget to include the appropriate headers.

```cpp
#include <string>
#include "Birthday.h"

class People {
public:
  People(std::string n, Birthday bo);
private:
  std::string name;
  Birthday dateOfBirth;
};
```
