# 10. Selection Operator

## `#ifndef` & `#define`

We created separate header and source files for our class, which resulted in this header file:

```cpp
#ifndef MYCLASS_H
#define MYCLASS_H

class MyClass
{
  public:
    MyClass();
  protected:
  private:
};

#endif // MYCLASS_H
```

`#ifndef` stands for "if not defined". The first pair of statements tells the program to define the `MyClass` header file if it has not been defined already. `#endif` ends the condition. This prevents a header file from being included more than once within one file.

**What is the purpose of `#ifndef` and `#define` directives in header files?**

- Makes programs run faster
- They are needed by `std` namespace
- They prevent a header file from being included more than once within one file

## Member Functions

Let's create a sample function called `myPrint()` in our class.

**MyClass.h**

```cpp
class MyClass
{
  public:
    MyClass();
    void myPrint();
};
```

**MyClass.cpp**

```cpp
#include "MyClass.h"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

MyClass::MyClass() {
}

void MyClass::myPrint() {
  cout << "Hello" << endl;
}
```

Since `myPrint()` is a regular member function, it's necessary to specify its return type in both the declaration and the definition.

**Drag and drop from the options below to prototype the `myPrint` function in the `Sally` class declaration.**

```cpp
Sally {
  public:
    Sally();
    void myPrint();
};
```

## Dot Operator

Next, we'll create an object of the type `MyClass`, and call its `myPrint()` function using the dot (`.`) operator:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass
{
    public:
        MyClass();
        void myPrint();
};

MyClass::MyClass() {
}
void MyClass::myPrint() {
    cout << "Hello" << endl;
}

int main() {
    MyClass obj;
    obj.myPrint(); // Using the dot operator to call the member function
}
```

**Drag and drop from the options below to declare an object of the `Sally` class in the `main` function, and call its `myPrint` member function using the `.` (dot) operator.**

```cpp
int main() {
    obj.myPrint(); // Correctly calling the member function
}
```

## Pointers

We can also use a pointer to access the object's members. The following pointer points to the `obj` object:

```cpp
MyClass obj;
MyClass *ptr = &obj;
```

**Fill in the blanks to declare a pointer to `obj`:**

```cpp
Sally obj;
Sally *sallyPtr = &obj; // Pointer to the object
```

## Selection Operator

The arrow member selection operator (`->`) is used to access an object's members with a pointer.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass
{
    public:
        MyClass();
        void myPrint();
};

MyClass::MyClass() {
}
void MyClass::myPrint() {
    cout << "Hello" << endl;
}

int main() {
    MyClass obj;
    MyClass *ptr = &obj;
    ptr->myPrint(); // Arrow operator is used to access member functions via pointer

    return 0;
}
```

When working with an object, use the dot member selection operator (`.`). When working with a pointer to the object, use the arrow member selection operator (`->`).

To call the `getCharge()` method using a pointer to an object, you should use the arrow operator (`->`). This operator is used to access members of a class or structure through a pointer.

**Here's how you can complete the code:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Phone
{
    public:
        int charge;
        Phone() {
            charge = 100;
        }
        void use() {
            charge -= 10;
        }
        void getCharge() {
            cout << charge;
        }
};

int main() {
    Phone p;
    p.use();      // Using the use() method to decrease the charge
    Phone *ptr = &p;  // Pointer to the Phone object

    // Call the getCharge() method using the pointer
    ptr->getCharge();  // Arrow operator is used to access member functions via pointer

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `p.use();` calls the `use()` method on the `Phone` object `p`, reducing its charge by 10.
- `Phone *ptr = &p;` creates a pointer `ptr` that holds the address of the `Phone` object `p`.
- `ptr->getCharge();` uses the arrow operator (`->`) to call the `getCharge()` method on the `Phone` object via the pointer `ptr`.

**Type in the missing arrow member selection operator to call `myPrint()` function via `sallyPtr`:**

```cpp
Sally obj;
Sally *sallyPtr = &obj;
sallyPtr->myPrint(); // Correctly calling the member function using the arrow operator
```
