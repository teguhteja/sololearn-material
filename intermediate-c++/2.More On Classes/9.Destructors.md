# 9. Destructors

## Destructors  
Destructors are special member functions in C++, similar to constructors, but instead of being called when an object is created, they are called when an object is destroyed or deleted. They are essential for releasing resources like memory or closing files before the program exits.

### Key Concepts:
- Destructors are invoked automatically when an object goes out of scope or when the `delete` expression is applied to an object.
- **Syntax**: The destructor's name is the same as the class name, but it is prefixed with a tilde (`~`).

---

### **Which statement about C++ constructors and destructors is correct?**
- **Correct Answer**: Constructor runs when an object is created; destructor runs when it is deleted.

---

### Destructors Syntax
```cpp
class MyClass {
  public: 
    ~MyClass() {
     // Destructor code here
    }
};
```
- Destructors can't return values or take parameters.
- Each class can have only **one destructor**.
  
Destructors are helpful for releasing resources like memory, closing files, or freeing up resources used by the program.

---

### Destructor Sign:
To declare a destructor, use the `~` symbol before the class name:
```cpp
~MyClass();
```

### Example: Declaring and Defining a Destructor
#### Declaring Destructor in Header File (`MyClass.h`):
```cpp
class MyClass
{
  public:
   MyClass();
   ~MyClass();  // Destructor declaration
};
```

#### Defining Destructor in Source File (`MyClass.cpp`):
```cpp
#include "MyClass.h"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

MyClass::MyClass() {
  cout << "Constructor" << endl;
}

MyClass::~MyClass() {
  cout << "Destructor" << endl;
}
```

In this example:
- **Constructor** is called when an object of `MyClass` is created.
- **Destructor** is called when the object goes out of scope or is deleted.

---

### Scope of Destructors
Destructors cannot take parameters, and they cannot be overloaded. Each class has only one destructor. If you donâ€™t define a destructor, the compiler generates a default destructor.

---

### **True Statements About Destructors**:
- Destructors are called when an object is deleted.
- Each class can only have **one destructor**.
- Defining a destructor is **optional** unless there are resources that need to be released.

---

### Example: Destructor in Action
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class MyClass {
  public:
    MyClass();   // Constructor
    ~MyClass();  // Destructor
};

MyClass::MyClass() {
  cout << "Constructor" << endl;
}

MyClass::~MyClass() {
  cout << "Destructor" << endl;
}

int main() {
  MyClass obj;  // Object creation triggers constructor
}  // When `main` finishes, destructor is automatically called
```

**Output**:
```
Constructor
Destructor
```

When the program runs, the constructor is called when the object is created, and the destructor is automatically called when the program finishes, or the object goes out of scope.

---

### Destructors are:
- Called when an object is deleted or goes out of scope.
- Essential for resource management in classes.
