# 31. Working with Files

## Working with Files
Another useful C++ feature is the ability to read and write to files. This requires the standard C++ library called `fstream`.

Three new data types are defined in `fstream`:

- **ofstream**: Output file stream that creates and writes information to files.
- **ifstream**: Input file stream that reads information from files.
- **fstream**: General file stream, with both `ofstream` and `ifstream` capabilities that allow it to create, read, and write information to files.

To perform file processing in C++, the header files `<iostream>` and `<fstream>` must be included in the C++ source file.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
```

These classes are derived directly or indirectly from the classes `istream` and `ostream`. We have already used objects whose types were these classes: `cin` is an object of class `istream` and `cout` is an object of class `ostream`.

**Which header file should be included to work with files?**

```
<fstream>
```

## Opening a File
A file must be opened before you can read from it or write to it. 

Either the `ofstream` or `fstream` object may be used to open a file for writing.

Let's open a file called `"test.txt"` and write some content to it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ofstream MyFile;
    MyFile.open("test.txt");

    MyFile << "Some text. \n";
}
```

The above code creates an `ofstream` object called `MyFile` and uses the `open()` function to open the `"test.txt"` file on the file system. As you can see, the same stream output operator (`<<`) is used to write into the file.

If the specified file does not exist, the `open` function will create it automatically.

## Rearrange the Code
Here is an example of rearranging the code to write `"I love C++"` into `myfile.txt`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ofstream MyFile;
    MyFile.open("myfile.txt");

    MyFile << "I love C++. \n";
    MyFile.close();
}
```

## Closing a File
When you've finished working with a file, close it using the member function `close()`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ofstream MyFile;
    MyFile.open("test.txt");

    MyFile << "Some text! \n";
    MyFile.close();
}
```

Running this code will create a `"test.txt"` file in the directory of your project with `"Some text!"` written in it.

You also have the option of specifying a path for your file in the `open` function, as it can be in a location other than that of your project.

**Which function should be called to close the file?**

- exit
- close ✅
- delete
- terminate
```
