# 1. Preprocessor Directives

## Preprocessor Directives

The C preprocessor uses the `#` directives to make substitutions in program source code before compilation.

For example, the line `#include <stdio.h>` is replaced by the contents of the `stdio.h` header file before a program is compiled.

### Preprocessor directives and their uses:

- `#include` - Including header files.
- `#define`, `#undef` - Defining and undefining macros.
- `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#if`, `#else`, `#elif`, `#endif` - Conditional compilation.
- `#pragma` - Implementation and compiler specific.
- `#error`, `#warning` - Output an error or warning message (An error halts compilation).

> **Note**: Do NOT put a semicolon character at the end of a `#` directive.

### Quiz:
Which of the following preprocessor directives allows you to include header files in the source code?

- `#including`
- `#define`
- `#include`
- `#ifdef`

## The `#include` Directive

The `#include` directive is for including header files in a program. A header file declares a collection of functions and macros for a library, a term that comes from the way the collection of code can be reused. 

Some useful C libraries are:

- **stdio**: Input/output functions, including `printf` and file operations.
- **stdlib**: Memory management and other utilities.
- **string**: Functions for handling strings.
- **errno**: Global error variable and error code macros.
- **math**: Common mathematical functions.
- **time**: Time/date utilities.

Corresponding header files for the libraries end with `.h` by convention. The `#include` directive expects brackets (`<>`) around the header filename if the file should be searched for in the compiler include paths.

A user-defined header file is also given the `.h` extension, but is referred to with quotation marks, as in `"myutil.h"`. When quotation marks are used, the file is searched for in the source code directory.

For example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "myutil.h"
```

Some developers use `.hpp` extension for header files.

**Task:**  
Type in a code to include the `stdio.h` header file:  
`#include <stdio.h>`

## The `#define` Directive

The `#define` directive is used to create object-like macros for constants based on values or expressions. It can also be used to create function-like macros with arguments that will be replaced by the preprocessor.

Be cautious with function-like definitions. Keep in mind that the preprocessor does a direct replacement without any calculations, which can lead to unexpected results. Consider the following program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define PI 3.14
#define AREA(r) (PI*r*r)

int main() {
    float radius = 2;
    printf("%3.2f\n", PI);
    printf("Area is %5.2f\n", AREA(radius));
    printf("Area with radius + 1: %5.2f\n", AREA(radius+1));
    return 0;
}
```

Before compilation, the preprocessor expands every macro identifier. In this case, every occurrence of `PI` is replaced with `3.14`, and `AREA(arg)` is replaced with the expression `PI*arg*arg`. The final code sent to the compiler will already have the constant values in place.

Notice how `AREA(radius+1)` becomes `PI*radius+1*radius+1`, which results in incorrect calculations. The solution is to enclose each parameter in parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define PI 3.14
#define AREA(r) (PI*(r)*(r))

int main() {
    float radius = 2;
    printf("%3.2f\n", PI);
    printf("Area is %5.2f\n", AREA(radius));
    printf("Area with radius + 1: %5.2f\n", AREA(radius+1));
    return 0;
}
```

This produces the correct output:  
`Area with radius + 1: 28.26`

**Task:**  
Type in a code to define a preprocessor macro for calculating the square of the argument:  
`#define SQR(x) (x*x)`

## Formatting Preprocessor Directives

When using preprocessor directives, the `#` must be the first character on a line. However, there can be any amount of white space before the `#` and between the `#` and the directive.

If a `#` directive is lengthy, you can use the `\` continuation character to extend the definition over more than one line.

For example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define VERY_LONG_CONSTANT \
23.678901

#define MAX 100
#define MIN 0
#    define SQUARE(x) \
    (x*x)

int main() {
    printf("%d\n", VERY_LONG_CONSTANT * SQUARE(2));
    return 0;
}
```

There can be any amount of white space before the `#` and between the `#` and the directive.

**Task:**  
Type in the missing continuation character to extend the definition of the macro over more than one line:  
`#define A_LONG_MACRO \ 42.4256789`

## Predefined Macro Definitions

Some macros are predefined by the compiler and provide useful information about the code.

For example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char curr_time[10];
    char curr_date[12];
    int std_c;

    strcpy(curr_time, __TIME__);
    strcpy(curr_date, __DATE__);
    printf("%s %s\n", curr_time, curr_date);
    printf("This is line %d\n", __LINE__);
    std_c = __STDC__;
    printf("STDC is %d", std_c);

    return 0;
}
```

**Quiz:**  
Which of the following is the predefined macro representing the current date?

- `__TIME__`
- `__DATE__`
- `__FILE__`

Answer: `__DATE__`
