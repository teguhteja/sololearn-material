# Using Pointers

## Introduction

Let's learn how to use pointers and why they are useful.

We have already seen a pointer in the `scanf()` function when taking input:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int age;
    scanf("%d", &age);

    printf("%d", age);

    return 0;
}
```

The `scanf()` function takes a pointer as its parameter and replaces its value with the value that was used as input.

## Returning Multiple Values Using Pointers

Another thing we can accomplish using pointer parameters is to return multiple values from a function.

As you remember, the `return` keyword is used to return a value from a function; however, it can only return a single value.

In the case of pointer parameters, we can use any number of pointers and set their values from the function.

For example:

```c
void divide(int* x, int* y, int by) {
    *x /= by;
    *y /= by;
}
```

The function takes two pointers and another integer, then divides the two pointer values by the integer value. This way, two values are changed by the function.

Note that the function accesses the values of the pointers using the `*` operator.

## Using Pointers in Functions

Here is how we can use our `divide()` function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void divide(int* x, int* y, int by) {
    *x /= by;
    *y /= by;
}

int main() {
    int x = 4200;
    int y = 670;

    divide(&x, &y, 10);
    
    printf("%d %d", x, y);

    return 0;
}
```

Note that we pass the memory addresses of the variables to the function as its parameters. The function changes the values of the variables using their pointers. This is how you can return multiple values from functions.

### Example: What is the Output?

Consider the following code:

```c
void change(int *x, int y) {
    *x = y;
    y = *x;
}

int main() {
    int a = 8;
    int b = 3;
    change(&b, a);
    printf("%d", b);

    return 0;
}
```

What do you think the output will be?

## Pointers and Arrays

Another use case of pointers is arrays.

The name of an array is actually a pointer to its first element.

For example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};

    printf("%d", *x);

    return 0;
}
```

This will output the value of the first element of the array.

### Accessing Array Elements Using Pointers

Array values are stored continuously in memory. Thus, each next element can be accessed by incrementing the pointer:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    int* p = x;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        printf("%d \n", *p);
        p++;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

During each loop iteration, we increment the memory address of the pointer by 1, using `p++`. This sets the pointer to the next element of the array. This allows us to easily access any array element.

### Quiz: Pointer and Array Access

If `x` is an array, what is `x[2]` equivalent to?

- `*x+2`
- `&(x+2)`
- `*(x+1)`
- `*(x+2)`

## Lesson Takeaways

You did it! Remember:

- Pointers can be used as function parameters, allowing the function to modify and set the values of multiple variables.
- The name of an array is actually a pointer to its first element.
- We can simply increment the pointer to an array to access its elements. If `p` is a pointer to the array, `p+1` is the address of the second element, `p+2` is the address of the third element, and so on.


### Summary of Changes:
1. **Section Titles:** Added structured subheadings to clearly differentiate between sections such as "Introduction," "Returning Multiple Values Using Pointers," and "Pointers and Arrays."
2. **Code Blocks:** Properly formatted all code examples with syntax highlighting for better visibility.
3. **Formatting Fixes:** Improved the flow of content and added more descriptive explanations where needed.
4. **Quiz Section:** Added a quiz section to test understanding of pointer and array access.

This improved format should make the content clearer and easier to study.
