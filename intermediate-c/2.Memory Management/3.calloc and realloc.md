# 3. `calloc` and `realloc`

## The `calloc` Function

The `calloc()` function allocates memory based on the size of a specific item, such as a structure.

The program below uses `calloc` to allocate memory for a structure and `malloc` to allocate memory for the string within the structure:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef struct {
  int num;
  char *info;
} record;

int main() {
  record *recs;
  int num_recs = 2;
  int k;
  char str[] = "This is information";

  recs = calloc(num_recs, sizeof(record));
  if (recs != NULL) {
    for (k = 0; k < num_recs; k++) {
      (recs+k)->num = k;
      (recs+k)->info = malloc(sizeof(str));
      strcpy((recs+k)->info, str);
    }
  }

  for (k = 0; k < num_recs; k++) {
    printf("%d\t%s\n", (recs+k)->num, (recs+k)->info);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

`calloc` allocates blocks of memory within a contiguous block of memory for an array of structure elements. You can navigate from one structure to the next with pointer arithmetic.

After allocating room for a structure, memory must be allocated for the string within the structure. Using a pointer for the `info` member allows any length string to be stored.

Dynamically allocated structures are the basis of linked lists and binary trees as well as other data structures.

**Run the code and see how it works!**

### Fill in the blanks to allocate memory for 3 record structures:

```c
typedef struct {
  int num;
  char *info;
} record;
record *recs;
recs = calloc(3, sizeof(record));
```

## The `realloc` Function

The `realloc()` function expands a current block to include additional memory.

For example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int *ptr;
  ptr = malloc(10 * sizeof(*ptr));  /* a block of 10 ints */
  if (ptr != NULL) {
    *(ptr+2) = 50;  /* assign 50 to third int */
  }
  ptr = realloc(ptr, 100 * sizeof(*ptr)); /* 100 ints */
  *(ptr+30) = 75;
  printf("%d %d", *(ptr+2), *(ptr+30));

  return 0;
}
```

`realloc` leaves the original content in memory and expands the block to allow for more storage.

### What is the output of this code?

```c
int *arr = malloc(sizeof(int));

*arr = 13;

arr = realloc(arr, 2 * sizeof(int));

*(arr + 1) = *arr;

printf("%d", *(arr + 1));
```

- **Output:** `13`
