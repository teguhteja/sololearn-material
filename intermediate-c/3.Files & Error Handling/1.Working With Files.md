# 1.Working With Files

## Accessing Files

In C, files can be opened, read from, and written to using the `FILE` type, which manages the file stream and tracks where reading and writing last occurred. The `stdio.h` library provides functions for file handling:

- **`FILE`**: Typedef for defining a file pointer.

- **`fopen(filename, mode)`**: Returns a `FILE` pointer to the file named `filename` opened in the specified `mode`. If the file cannot be opened, `NULL` is returned.

  **Mode options:**
  - `r`: Open for reading (file must exist)
  - `w`: Open for writing (file need not exist)
  - `a`: Open for appending (file need not exist)
  - `r+`: Open for reading and writing from the beginning
  - `w+`: Open for reading and writing, overwriting the file
  - `a+`: Open for reading and writing, appending to the file

- **`fclose(fp)`**: Closes the file opened with `FILE *fp`, returning `0` if successful. `EOF` (end of file) is returned if there is an error.

**Example Program:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  FILE *fptr;
  
  fptr = fopen("myfile.txt", "w");
  if (fptr == NULL) {
    printf("Error opening file.");
    return -1;
  }
  fclose(fptr);
  return 0;
}
```

**Note:** When using a string literal for the filename, the escape sequence `\\` represents a single backslash. This program returns a `-1` error code if there is an issue opening the file. Proper error handling will be covered in a future lesson. Always close a file when you're done using it to follow good programming practice.

**Fill in the blanks:**

```c
char buffer[200];
FILE* fptr = fopen("myfile.txt", "r");
fgets(buffer, 20, fptr);
```

## Reading from a File

The `stdio.h` library also includes functions for reading from an open file. You can read a file one character at a time or read an entire string into a character buffer (typically a `char` array used for temporary storage).

- **`fgetc(fp)`**: Returns the next character from the file pointed to by `fp`. If the end of the file is reached, `EOF` is returned.

- **`fgets(buff, n, fp)`**: Reads up to `n-1` characters from the file pointed to by `fp` and stores the string in `buff`. A `NULL` character `'\0'` is appended as the last character in `buff`. If `fgets` encounters a newline character or the end of file before reaching `n-1` characters, only the characters up to that point are stored.

- **`fscanf(fp, conversion_specifiers, vars)`**: Reads characters from the file pointed to by `fp` and assigns input to a list of variables using `conversion_specifiers`. Similar to `scanf`, `fscanf` stops reading when a space or newline is encountered.

**Example Program:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *fptr;
    int stock;
    char buffer[200], item[10], c;
    float price;
    
    /* myfile.txt: Inventory\n100 Widget 0.29\nEnd of List */
    fptr = fopen("myfile.txt", "w");

    /* write to file */
    fprintf(fptr, "Inventory\n");
    fprintf(fptr, "%d %s %f\n", 100, "Widget", 0.29);
    fputs("End of List", fptr);
    fclose(fptr);
    
    /* myfile.txt: Inventory\n100 Widget 0.29\nEnd of List */
    fptr = fopen("myfile.txt", "r");
    fgets(buffer, 20, fptr); /* read a line */
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
    fscanf(fptr, "%d%s%f", &stock, item, &price); /* read data */
    printf("%d %s %4.2f\n", stock, item, price);
    while ((c = fgetc(fptr)) != EOF) /* read the rest of the file */
        printf("%c", c);
    fclose(fptr);
    return 0;
}
```

**Note:** The `gets()` function reads up to a newline character, `fscanf()` reads data according to conversion specifiers, and the `while` loop reads one character at a time until the end of the file. Error checking for file opening (e.g., a `NULL` pointer) is omitted here for brevity.

**Fill in the blanks:**

```c
char buffer[200];
FILE* fptr = fopen("myfile.txt", "r");
fgets(buffer, 20, fptr);
```

## Writing to a File

The `stdio.h` library also provides functions for writing to files. When writing, newline characters `'\n'` must be explicitly added.

- **`fputc(char, fp)`**: Writes the character `char` to the file pointed to by `fp`.

- **`fputs(str, fp)`**: Writes the string `str` to the file pointed to by `fp`.

- **`fprintf(fp, str, vars)`**: Prints the string `str` to the file pointed to by `fp`. `str` can include format specifiers and a list of variables `vars`.

**Example Program:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  FILE *fptr;
  char filename[50];
  char c;

  printf("Enter the filename of the file to create: ");
  gets(filename);
  fptr = fopen(filename, "w");

  /* write to file */
  fprintf(fptr, "Inventory\n");
  fprintf(fptr, "%d %s %f\n", 100, "Widget", 0.29);
  fputs("End of List", fptr);

  fclose(fptr);

  /* read the file contents */
  fptr = fopen(filename, "r");
  while ((c = getc(fptr)) != EOF)
    printf("%c", c);
  fclose(fptr);
  return 0;
}
```

**Note:** The `"w"` argument specifies "writing mode" for the `fopen` function.

**Fill in the blanks:**

```c
FILE* ptr = fopen("sample.txt", "w");
```
