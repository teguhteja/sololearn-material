# Error Handling

## Exception Handling

Central to good programming practices is using error handling techniques. Even the most solid coding skills may not prevent a program from crashing if you forget to include exception handling.

An **exception** is any situation that causes your program to stop normal execution. Exception handling, also called error handling, is an approach to processing runtime errors.

While C does not explicitly support exception handling, there are ways to manage errors:

- **Prevent Errors**: Write code to prevent errors in the first place. For example, check user input to ensure it is valid. When performing division, ensure that division by zero is avoided.

- **Graceful Termination**: Use the `exit` statement to gracefully end program execution when an error is detected. This prevents the program from crashing unexpectedly.

- **Error Identification**: Use `errno`, `perror()`, and `strerror()` to identify errors through error codes.

**What is an exception?**

- An exception is any situation that causes the program to stop normal execution.

## The `exit` Command

The `exit` command immediately stops the execution of a program and sends an exit code back to the calling process. For example, if a program is called by another program, the calling program may need to know the exit status.

Using `exit` to avoid a program crash is good practice as it closes any open file connections and processes.

You can return any value through an `exit` statement, but `0` for success and `-1` for failure are typical. The predefined `stdlib.h` macros `EXIT_SUCCESS` and `EXIT_FAILURE` are also commonly used.

**Example:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
  int x = 10;
  int y = 0;

  if (y != 0) {
    printf("x / y = %d", x / y);
  } else {
    printf("Divisor is 0. Program exiting.");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

In this example, if `y` is `0`, the program will print an error message and exit with a failure status.

**Fill in the blanks to immediately stop the execution with error code `4` of the program if the value of `num` is `0`:**

```c
int num = 0;
if (num == 0) {
  exit(4);
}
```
