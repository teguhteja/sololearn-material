# 2. Milestones & Estimations

A project is a sequence of tasks that must be completed for successful delivery. Missing some of these tasks usually results in missed deadlines and increased costs.

In this lesson, you'll learn to use AI to scope a project and break it into its constituent parts. Let's see how!

The successful completion of a project results in the production of items. These items can be physical products like machine parts or non-physical products like online documents, reports, or software applications.

In project management, we refer to these items as:

- milestones
- deliverables
- stakeholders

Deliverables need to be agreed upon during the definition phase of a project. A list of tasks that ensures that all the project deliverables are produced must be identified.

Let's see what the AI Assistant comes up with for the case of the garden project.

A task can usually be broken down further into subtasks. You'll need to tell your AI what level of detail you want the tasks broken down into, which is known as **granularity**.

Give it a try!
