# 4. Validation & Review


Validation is the next step in project planning, ensuring that projects are ready for deployment and meet the desired outcomes.

In this lesson, you'll learn to double-check your project plan and reflect on it. Let's see how!

---

### Project Plan Validation

Always check that you have reserved a bit of money for contingencies. Contingencies refer to extra potential costs that you factor into the project budget.

AI can help you identify sources of contingency and allocate money to them.

---

### Common Contingencies and Allocations

- **Volunteer availability**  
  Volunteers may have unpredictable schedules or commitments that could impact their availability to work on the community garden project.  
  **Contingency**: 5% of total project cost for potential overtime costs or additional labor expenses.

- **Weather conditions**  
  Unforeseen weather events such as heavy rainfall, storms, or droughts could delay construction or planting schedules.  
  **Contingency**: 10% of total project cost for weather-related delays or additional equipment rental.

- **Price fluctuations of supplies**  
  The cost of supplies like soil, plants, tools, and materials may increase unexpectedly due to market fluctuations or supply chain disruptions.  
  **Contingency**: 3% of total project cost for potential price increases on supplies.

- **Permitting and regulatory issues**  
  Delays in obtaining necessary permits or compliance with local regulations could slow down the project timeline and require additional resources.  
  **Contingency**: 5% of total project cost for legal fees or expediting permit costs.

- **Equipment breakdowns**  
  The breakdown or malfunction of essential equipment such as gardening tools, machinery, or irrigation systems could lead to project delays and repair expenses.  
  **Contingency**: 2% of total project cost for equipment maintenance or replacement costs.

### Recommendations for Managing Contingencies

- **Identify potential risks**  
  Conduct a risk assessment to identify possible sources of contingency based on past experiences, project requirements, and external factors.

- **Allocate a contingency reserve**  
  Set aside a specific percentage of the project budget as a contingency reserve to cover unforeseen expenses or risks as they arise.

- **Regular monitoring and communication**  
  Keep track of project progress, budget expenditures, and any potential risks that may impact the project. Communicate regularly with stakeholders to address any issues promptly.

- **Utilize risk management strategies**  
  Implement risk mitigation strategies to minimize the likelihood or impact of potential risks. This could include diversifying suppliers, scheduling buffer time in the project timeline, or securing backup resources.

### Estimated Total Cost of Contingencies

Considering the above sources of contingency and their estimated costs, the total cost of contingencies for the community garden project is approximately **25%** of the total project budget. It is essential to plan and manage these contingencies effectively to ensure the successful completion of the project within the budget and timeline.

### AI in Project Plan Validation

Another way to use AI to double-check your project plan is to provide the AI with your own plan, then ask whether something important is missing.

**Question**: Have you ever had to deal with contingency in your projects? Share your experience in the comments.

### Project Review

After a project has been completed, it is a good practice to discuss what went well and what went less well. This step is the **project review**.

The project review results in learnings that can be applied to future projects. How do you think project review reviews can improve the outcomes of future projects?

Always record the information from project review meetings.

### AI and Meeting Notes

You can use AI to put together notes from the project review meetings into a report.

**Question**: What type of information would you record from the project review phase that can be helpful in the future?
