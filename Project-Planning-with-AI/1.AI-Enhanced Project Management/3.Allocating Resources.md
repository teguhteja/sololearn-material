# 3. Allocating Resources

People are good at different things. The objective in any project is to use everyone's skills to the maximum.

Allocating roles is especially difficult when you have a larger project and you've got a lot of people and tasks to match up. Let's see how AI can help you with this.

In some situations, you'll start a new project without a team. AI can help you identify the expertise required to successfully complete the project. Let's give it a try.

In other situations, you'll have to allocate a given list of roles on your project. This list has been shared with the AI Assistant. Let's see what we get.

Allocating people to tasks is difficult because the ideal person might be busy with something else, sometimes people don't like doing the things that they're good at, or we want them to develop new skills. 

What else do you think needs to be taken into consideration when allocating roles to tasks?

**AI CHAT:**
*Suggest a list of materials, tools, and equipment required for the garden project.*

**Materials:**

- Seeds and plants
- Soil and compost
- Mulch
- Fertilizers and pesticides (organic preferably)
- Garden beds or containers
- Irrigation system (hoses, watering cans, sprinklers, etc.)
- Garden markers or signage

**Tools:**

- Shovels and spades

These resources are essential for the successful planning, execution, and maintenance of the community garden project.

In project management, a point of congestion is called a "bottleneck." Matching resources to tasks is known as "resource allocation."

---

An experienced project manager can anticipate potential problems and mitigate them with a good project plan.

Certainties:

- The community will benefit from the garden project.
- There will be a need for volunteers to support various aspects of the project.
- Fundraising will be required to cover costs associated with the project.
- Designing the garden layout will be essential for the success of the project.
- Supplies will need to be purchased to support the garden development.
