# 2. Creating Classes & Objects

## Creating Classes
To create your own custom objects, you must first create the corresponding classes. Here's how to do it in **Eclipse**:

1. Right-click on the `src` folder.
2. Select **Create → New → Class**.
3. Give your class a name and click **Finish** to add the new class to your project.

For example, let's create a simple method in our new class:

```java
// Animal.java
public class Animal {
  void bark() {
    System.out.println("Woof-Woof");
  }
}
```

In the `Animal` class, we have declared a `bark()` method that outputs "Woof-Woof". To use this class and its methods, we need to declare an object of that class.

## Example: Creating a Class with a Method

Here’s how to create a class `A` with a single method called `test`:

```java
public class A {
  public void test() {
    System.out.println("Hi");
  }  
}
```

This class has one method `test()` that prints "Hi".

---

## Creating Objects
Now, let’s create an object in the `main` method and call the method of the `Animal` class.

```java
public class Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof-Woof");
    }
}

class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal dog = new Animal();  // Create a new Animal object
        dog.bark();                 // Call the bark() method
    }
}
```

### Output:
```
Woof-Woof
```

Here, `dog` is an object of type `Animal`. We can call the `bark()` method using the dot notation, which is used to access the object's attributes and methods.

## Exercise: Create a Loading Message

Create a class `Loading` that has one public method called `LoadingMessage()`, which prints "Loading" when called. Then, create an object named `loading` and call that method.

```java
public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       // Create a Loading object and call LoadingMessage()
       Loading loading = new Loading();
       loading.LoadingMessage();
   }
}

class Loading {
     // Method that prints "Loading"
     public void LoadingMessage(){
         System.out.println("Loading");
     }
}
```

### Output:
```
Loading
```

---

## Example: Creating an Object of Class A in Class B

Fill in the blanks to create an object of class `A` inside class `B` and call its `test()` method:

```java
public class A {
  public void test() {
    System.out.println("Hi");
  }	 
}

class B {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    A obj = new A();   // Create an object of class A
    obj.test();        // Call the test() method
  }
}
```

### Output:
```
Hi
```
