# 1. Object-Oriented Programming

## Object-Orientation
Java uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a programming style that brings programming closer to real-world thinking.

In OOP, each object is an independent unit with a unique identity, just like objects in the real world.

For example:
- An apple is an object.
- A mug is an object.

Each object has a **unique identity**. Even if two mugs look identical, they are still separate, unique objects.

### Attributes
Objects also have characteristics or **attributes** that describe them. For example:
- A car can be red or blue.
- A mug can be full or empty.

Attributes describe the current **state** of an object.

### Behavior
In the real world, objects have behaviors:
- A car moves.
- A phone rings.

Similarly, objects in programming also exhibit **behavior** based on their type.

### Summary
In object-oriented programming, each object has three main aspects:
1. **Identity**: A unique identifier for each object.
2. **Attributes**: The current state of the object.
3. **Behavior**: The actions the object can perform.

## Classes
A **class** describes what the object will be, but is separate from the object itself.

Think of a class as a **blueprint** or a **definition** for creating objects. Using the same class, you can create multiple objects. The class defines the **attributes** and **behavior** of the objects it creates.

### Example
Some common attributes and behaviors in objects:

| Object Type | Attributes                     | Behavior              |
|-------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Car         | color, speed, make              | start, stop, accelerate |
| Phone       | brand, model, battery percentage| call, text, charge    |

In other words, an **object** is an instance of a class.

### Summary Points
- An object is an instance of a class.
- A class is a blueprint that defines the attributes and behavior of objects.
