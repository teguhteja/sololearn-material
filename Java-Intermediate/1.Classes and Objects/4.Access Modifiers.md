# 4.Access Modifiers

Access Modifiers
Now let's discuss the public keyword in front of the main method.

public static void main(String[ ] args)
JAVA
public is an access modifier, meaning that it is used to set the level of access. You can use access modifiers for classes, attributes, and methods.

For classes, the available modifiers are public or default (left blank), as described below:

public: The class is accessible by any other class.

default: The class is accessible only by classes in the same package.

The following choices are available for attributes and methods:

default: A variable or method declared with no access control modifier is available to any other class in the same package.

public: Accessible from any other class.

protected: Provides the same access as the default access modifier, with the addition that subclasses can access protected methods and variables of the superclass (Subclasses and superclasses are covered in upcoming lessons).

private: Accessible only within the declared class itself.

Example:

public class Vehicle {
  private int maxSpeed;
  private int wheels;
  private String color;
  private double fuelCapacity;

  public void horn() {
    System.out.println("Beep!");
  }
}
JAVA
It's a best practice to keep the variables within a class private. The variables are accessible and modified using Getters and Setters.

To fix the issue and ensure that the fields of the `Country` class can be accessed and modified from the `Program` class, you need to change the access modifiers of the `name` and `capital` fields to `public`. This will allow the `Program` class to directly access them.

Hereâ€™s the corrected code:

```java
public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Country c = new Country();
        c.name = "France";
        c.capital = "Paris";
        System.out.println("Country:  " + c.name);
        System.out.println("Capital:  " + c.capital);
    }
}

class Country {
    // change the fields to public
    public String name;
    public String capital;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`private`**: Makes the fields accessible only within the class itself (which was causing the issue).
- **`protected`**: Makes the fields accessible within the same package or subclasses, but still not enough for other classes.
- **`public`**: Makes the fields accessible from anywhere, including other classes (which is the solution here).

By changing both `name` and `capital` to `public`, they can now be accessed and modified directly from the `Program` class.
