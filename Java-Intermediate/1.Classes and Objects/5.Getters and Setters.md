# 5.Getters and Setters

Getters & Setters
Getters and Setters are used to effectively protect your data, particularly when creating classes. For each variable, the get method returns its value, while the set method sets the value.

Getters start with get, followed by the variable name, with the first letter of the variable name capitalized.

Setters start with set, followed by the variable name, with the first letter of the variable name capitalized.

Example:

public class Vehicle {
  private String color;

  // Getter
  public String getColor() {
    return color;
  }

 // Setter
  public void setColor(String c) {
    this.color = c;
  }
}
JAVA
The getter method returns the value of the attribute.

The setter method takes a parameter and assigns it to the attribute.

The keyword this is used to refer to the current object. Basically, this.color is the color attribute of the current object.

Drag and drop from the options below to define the set and get methods.

class A {
private int x;
public
int
getX() {
return
x
;
}
public
void
setX(int x) {
this.x = x;
}
}


Getters & Setters
Once our getter and setter have been defined, we can use it in our main:

public class Vehicle {
    private String color;
    
    // Getter
    public String getColor() {
        return color;
    }
    
    // Setter
    public void setColor(String c) {
        this.color = c;
    }
}

class Program {
    public static void main(String[ ] args) {
        Vehicle v1 = new Vehicle();
        v1.setColor("Red");
        System.out.println(v1.getColor());
    }
}

Getters and setters allow us to have control over the values. You may, for example, validate the given value in the setter before actually setting the value.

Getters and setters are fundamental building blocks for encapsulation, which will be covered in the next module.

To properly implement the solution using **Getters and Setters**, we will follow these steps:

1. Use the `setAge` method to validate if the age is less than 0, and if so, print "Invalid age" and set `age` to 0.
2. Use the `getAge` method to retrieve the value of `age`.
3. Modify the `main` method to set the age via the setter method.

Hereâ€™s the completed code:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner read = new Scanner(System.in);
        String name = read.nextLine();
        int age = read.nextInt();
        Student student = new Student();
        student.name = name;
        
        // Set the age using the setter method
        student.setAge(age);
        
        System.out.println("Name: " + student.name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + student.getAge());
    }
}

class Student {
    public String name;
    private int age;

    // Getter for age
    public int getAge() {
        return this.age;
    }

    // Setter for age with validation
    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age < 0) {
            System.out.println("Invalid age");
            this.age = 0; // Set age to 0 if invalid
        } else {
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Getter (`getAge`)**: Simply returns the current value of the `age` attribute.
- **Setter (`setAge`)**: Checks if the provided age is less than 0. If true, it prints "Invalid age" and sets the `age` to 0. Otherwise, it sets the provided age.

### Sample Input:
```
Olivia
-2
```

### Sample Output:
```
Invalid age
Name: Olivia
Age: 0
```

This implementation ensures proper encapsulation and data validation using getters and setters.

What would the name of the setter method for the class variable named "age" be?
