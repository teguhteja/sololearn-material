# 2. How to Train GenAI

---

### Select the diagram that best represents the relationships between the different areas in AI

- [ ] item  
- [ ] item  

---

GenAI is within the Machine Learning category because it's trained on:

- [ ] rules  
- [ ] data  

---

### Large Language Models (LLM)

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a Machine Learning model that can predict:

- [ ] fraudulent card transactions  
- [ ] the next word  

An LLM is trained in different phases. In phase one, it's trained on a vast and diverse corpus of unlabelled text data to learn patterns and structures without human assistance.

This first phase is:

- [ ] supervised learning  
- [ ] unsupervised learning  

---

Once an LLM has been trained to predict the next word, it then gets trained with labeled conversations to learn to follow human instructions and perform new tasks.

This process involves:

- [ ] rule-based AI  
- [ ] supervised learning  

---

### Foundation Models

At the core of GenAI are its foundation models. They are very versatile ML models that can be used in various applications for a wide range of tasks.

They are general-purpose and highly adaptable. This means you can:

- [ ] easily create a foundational model from scratch  
- [ ] build on top of a foundation model  

You can build on top of a foundation model, but creating one from scratch is very costly.

A type of foundation model that gives GenAI its ability to understand and use natural language is:

- [ ] Alexa  
- [ ] the LLM  

GenAI will soon be able to comprehend language, visual imagery, and sound all at the same time, thanks to the foundation models of the future.

It's often said that AI is a "general-purpose technology" like electricity, steam power, or the internet. What do you think that means?

### Fine-Tuning Foundation Models

Foundation models are trained on generic and diverse data. They are generalists, good at many tasks.

Fine-tuning is the process of further training a generic foundation model with more specific data, so that it becomes more skilled at certain tasks.

---

### BERT and GPT

BERT from Google and GPT from OpenAI are examples of early foundation models.

**GPT** stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. What do you think pre-trained means in the context of foundation models?

- [ ] It's unfinished  
- [ ] You can train/customize it even more  

A GPT model that has been further trained on legal documentation to be able to understand and explain legal terminology has been:

- [ ] overtrained  
- [ ] fine-tuned  

---

### Match the Training Processes with Their Datasets

- **Pre-training**:  
  - [ ] task-specific dataset  
  - [ ] generic dataset  

- **Fine-tuning**:  
  - [ ] task-specific dataset  
  - [ ] generic dataset  

---

### Fine-Tuning vs. Pre-training

The amount of new, specific data needed to fine-tune a model is usually small compared to all the data needed to pre-train a foundation model from scratch.

A foundation model is a generalist after pre-training and becomes a specialist after fine-tuning.

### Let's Recap

Nice work! You've just learned that:

⭐ Training a GenAI model involves phases of both unsupervised and supervised learning.  
⭐ Foundation models are versatile ML models good at many tasks and areas of expertise.  
⭐ Foundation models can be fine-tuned to excel in specific areas.

Next, we'll explore some limitations of LLMs and how to use them safely.
