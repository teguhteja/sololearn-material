# 4. Ethical AI Usage

---

GenAI is a powerful tool that can have real effects in the lives of many people. Developers work hard to make sure their tools are as safe to use as possible, but awareness of how to use GenAI ethically is important to ensure we don't cause harm to anyone.

When something is favored over others in an unfair way, that's called **bias**.

### Which of these is an example of bias?

- AI displaying ads for higher paying jobs to more men than women  

AI is revolutionizing how doctors make decisions. AI-assisted diagnosis is trained on patient data.

---

Bias could produce less accurate results for certain patients based on gender, race, ethnicity, age, or other demographic factors.

### What could be a cause of this bias?

- Lack of diversity in patient data  

---

An AI tool is used in healthcare to detect heart disease. The model has been trained on labeled male patient data.

This AI-assisted diagnosis tool is…

- [ ] biased  

Biases in certain industries like healthcare and construction are widely known, but bias can also come up in less expected places.

### Try regenerating a response several times

AI CHAT
Write a short character description of an old CEO.

_Response:_  
"The old CEO, with his graying hair and deep lines etched on his weathered face, exuded authority and wisdom. His commanding presence overshadowed any doubts, despite the occasional sexist remark that revealed underlying gender biases."

Do you see any bias in the generated responses? Discuss your observations in the comments.

Reducing biases in text responses can be easy. Simply adding details or prompting the AI to check for biases can help to generate a better response.

AI CHAT
Write a short character description of an old CEO named Leyla.  
Write a short character description of an old CEO. Do not include any gender bias.

_Response:_  
"A seasoned executive with a commanding presence, the old CEO exudes authority and wisdom. Known for their strategic vision and sharp business acumen, they command respect and admiration from colleagues and competitors alike."

### Try changing the prompt so the response is gender neutral

AI CHAT
Write a character description of a nurse.

_Response:_  
"A dedicated and compassionate caregiver, the nurse exudes professionalism and empathy. With a gentle touch and soothing demeanor, they provide comfort and support to patients in their time of need. Their strong work ethic and clinical skills make them an invaluable asset to the healthcare team."

Popular LLMs are constantly updating themselves using data from users' prompts. So if personal information is given, it may be vulnerable to data breaches.

### Which of these should not be included in prompts?

_Select all correct answers._  

---

### Select all examples of personal information

_Select all correct answers._  

"Write a letter to congratulate my coworker John Smith on his new promotion. His address is 1234 Apple Lane."

Deepfakes are AI-generated imitations of real people, which can be problematic if created without the person’s consent.

### Which image is a deepfake?

- item  
- item  

---

Deepfakes, voice cloning, and AI-powered scams are all ways GenAI is being used unethically. The Content Authenticity Initiative is a community with tools to help combat the unethical use of GenAI.

### What is the best practice when it comes to generating content with GenAI?

- Mark it as generated with AI  

---

As GenAI progresses, tools and strategies for identifying deepfake videos and voice cloning are also progressing.

### Do you know any ways to identify or report a deepfake? Share in the comments!

With GenAI's ability to create text, images, and audio that seems real, the spread of misinformation and its ability to influence politics and democracies is a growing concern.

### Which is a good practice when interacting with online content?

- Check where the information is coming from
