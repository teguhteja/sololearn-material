# 1. The Main GenAI Tools

Every GenAI tool works differently and has different strengths and weaknesses. The first step to ethically using GenAI is understanding the capabilities of the tool you're using.

In this lesson, we'll cover today's most popular GenAI tools.

### Big Tech and GenAI

Big tech companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta have the resources to research, design, train, and maintain large models from scratch.

This means:
- Anyone can train a large model from scratch at home.  
- Creating GenAI is costly.

OpenAI made the ChatGPT assistant, the DALL-E image generator, and the Sora video generator. All these tools can take text as input to produce an output.

### OpenAI's Models

OpenAI keeps improving and versioning their models. Currently, you can access GPT-3.5 for free or subscribe to GPT-4.

In the AI Chat, you can compare GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Try changing the model and giving the same prompt to both.

**AI CHAT SETTINGS**  
*Who is the prime minister of the UK?*

### Midjourney: A Competitor to DALL-E

Midjourney can produce:
- Audio  
- Text  
- Video  
- Images

DALL-E excels at easy content generation, while Midjourney provides advanced image editing commands.

### Google's Multi-Modal Model: Gemini

Google's approach was to create a multi-modal model called Gemini.

Multi-modal means that the model can be prompted with:
- Text only  
- Text, images, video, etc.

---

### Meta's AI Assistant

Meta has released the Meta AI assistant, which you can chat with in Messenger, while wearing Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, or on social media with celebrity clones.

Meta AI assistant can be prompted with:
- Text only  
- Text and voice

Meta has open-sourced their LLM. Open source code is publicly accessible and can be viewed, modified, and distributed by anyone.

LLM stands for:
- Long Learning Model  
- Large Language Model

---

### APIs and GenAI

Developers can build on top of open-source models to create GenAI tools.

To integrate a popular GenAI model into new products, developers use an API. APIs allow software to connect to a model to send requests and receive replies.

What could API stand for?
- Apple Photo Interface  
- Application Programming Interface

APIs can be used to integrate GenAI into another app. For example, adding an LLM-powered chatbot into a website to help with customer care.

Integrating GenAI allows companies to:
- Earn a lot of money on the stock market  
- Create powerful GenAI solutions

### GenAI for Automation and Creativity

GenAI can help you automate your daily tasks and explore new forms of creativity.

The tools are always evolving, so be sure to follow the latest trends.
