With GenAI, training simple machine learning models is easier than ever!

For this lesson, you'll take on the role of an ecologist and use AI to predict how climate change will affect a colony of birds that nests on a small island.

Each year, a colony of birds returns to the same island to nest. For the past 50 years, volunteers have counted the number of birds in the colony and recorded the average temperature on the island.

You have noticed that when the average temperature changes, the number of birds also changes. You hope to use machine learning to predict the number of birds in the future by measuring the temperature.

These numerical predictions can be made using…

classification
regression
clustering

Let's start by getting to know the data. The AI assistant has access to the data.

Visualizing your data is a great first step to identify patterns.

AI can create data visualizations. Let's give it a try

AI CHAT
Create a data visualization for this dataset

Visualizing relationships in your data is a good way to start the analysis process.

Do you notice any patterns in the visualization? Discuss with your fellow learners in the comments

A regression model looks at data to find a pattern. Different types of regression models use different lines to best match the data. Experiment with the two regression models

A regression model fits a line to the data in order to make predictions.

Select the model that will lead to more accurate predictions

Polynomial regression
Linear regression

Polynomial regression
Linear regression

You can now use regression to make predictions. When the average temperature is 16°C, a good prediction for the number of birds will be…

1000
250

The predictions from machine learning models don't always match up perfectly with the original data. Measuring the error between real data and predictions can tell you how well a model performs.

A smaller amount of error means the model is…

less accurate
more accurate

The R² score is a way to measure error to compare different regression models. The smaller the error, the higher the R² value.

Select the model that better fits the data

Model 2
Model 1

R² can also be represented as a percentage.

Match the value with its percentage

85% = 0.85
6% = 0.06

AI can quickly calculate R² values and compare different regression models with your data to help you choose the best model

AI CHAT
Compare different polynomial regression models

A model with the highest R2 isn't always the best choice. Overfitting happens when a model becomes unnecessarily complex. A good model should capture the underlying patterns in the data rather than fitting to the training data too closely.

Would you use this model to predict the number of birds when the average temperature is 16°C? Why?

Always use your intuition to check if the predictions from a model make sense.

Let's put it together!

AI CHAT
Use the degree 2 polynomial regression model to predict the population when the average temperature is 16 degrees

AI can easily create and train a regression model, but still needs human insight and intuition to make meaningful predictions.

What's something you could use a regression model for in your own work? Share with your fellow learners in the comments!

Let's recap
Great work! In this lesson you:

 

⭐ created regression models with GenAI

⭐ compared linear regression and polynomial regression models

⭐ used human judgment along with AI tools to learn from data
