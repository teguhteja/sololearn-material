Variables are key to web development. They allow you to store, label, and play with data.

 

In this lesson, you’ll learn to work with data that has been stored in variables.

Complete the code to create a new variable called device

device
"iPhone";

let movie = "Jurassic Park";

let year = 1993;
JS
Match the variable name with the data type it’s storing

movie:
year:

A variable’s name is used to identify where that information is stored. You can access the value that a variable is storing by calling its name.

What message will this code display?

let budget = 200;
alert(budget);
JS
200
budget

Once a variable has been created, you can use it in your code.

 

Call the variables to access the values they’re storing

```html
<script>
let message1 = "Welcome";
let message2 = "Test completed";
alert(message1);
console.log(message2);
</script>

```

How do you access the value stored in a variable?

Using exclamation marks
Calling the variable name

Code to display Welcome! in the alert box

let message = "
";
alert(
);

Code to log the variable’s value to the console

let username = "
Jane007
";
console.log(
username
);

You can update the value stored in a variable. The variable will forget the previously stored value.

 

Run the code to check the new stored value

```html
<script>
let price = 99;
price = 100;
alert(price);
</script>
```

Updating the value of a variable is called reassigning a variable.

What will the alert box display?

let points = 35;
points = 45;
alert(points);
JS
points
35
45

You don’t need to use let again when reassigning a new value to an already declared variable.

Code to change the value in the fruit variable to apple

fruit = "orange";
= "apple";

You can reassign a variable as many times as you need.

What will be logged in the console?

let msg = "Solo";
msg = "learn"
msg = "Sololearn";
console.log(msg);
JS
Sololearn
learn
Solo

Code to display 200 in the alert box

let quantity = 100;
quantity = 300;
= 200;
(quantity);


Translate course
Remember you can declare as many variables as you need for your program.

Code to declare the variables name and age

let
name
= "Anne";
let
age
=
37;

What will the alert box display?

let band = "Beatles";
let song = "Yesterday";
song = "Let it be";
alert(song);
JS
song
Let it be
Yesterday
Beatles

Variables need to be given a unique name.

If you declare 2 variables with the exact same name, your code will result in…

a working script
a bug


Translate course
Select the messages that will be logged in the console

let band = "Beatles";
let song = "Yesterday";
song = "Let it be";
console.log(song);
console.log(band);
JS
Select all correct answers.

Type to reassign the value of 900 to the variable price

let price = 300;
 = 900;

Lesson Takeaways
Well done! You learned that:

 

⭐ You can access the value stored in a variable by calling its name

⭐ Reassigning a variable will make the variable forget the previously stored value

In the next lesson, you’ll learn how to modify the content and structure of a page with JS.
