Data comes in different shapes and forms. Computers treat different types of data in different ways.

In this lesson, you’ll start working with different types of data and use variables to make your programs remember important information.

You learned to display alert messages for the user.

Complete to display a text message

<script>
(
);
</script>

In JS code, text messages need to be surrounded by...

curly brackets
quotation marks

If a piece of text data is missing quotation marks in JS code, this will result in…

a working script
a bug

A piece of text data is called string. You can use either single or double quotes to create a string, just ensure the opening and closing quotes match.

Complete to display a string

alert("Submitted
);
The choice of " or ' doesn’t affect the behavior of the string.

Numbers in JS code shouldn’t be enclosed in quotation marks.

Code to display an alert message with the number 500

<script>
alert
;
</script>

Code to log the number 360 in the console

<
>
console.log(
);
</script>

The code below will log an error to the console due to a bug.

Can you fix the bug so both the number and string are displayed in the console?

```html
<script>
console.log(100);
console.log(Test completed);
</script>
```


Computer programs use variables to store important information  that can be used again, like items in a shopping cart, prices and discounts.

 

To create a variable, use the word let followed by the variable name.

Complete the code to create a variable called item

item = "bike";


Translate course
A variable has a name and a value.

Complete the code to create a variable named city

let
"London";

You can think of a variable as a box that contains some information.

Use the image to identify the elements of the variable

variable name:
variable value:

To create a variable, give the variable a name and connect name and value with an equal = sign.

Complete to create a variable

let
9000;

You can create as many variables as you need in your programs.

 

Variables can store strings, numbers and other types of data.

Complete the code to create two variables

let city
"London";
population =
;


Complete the code to create two new variables

let book
"The Hobbit";
pages = 310;

let book = "The Hobbit";
let pages = 310;
JS
Match the variable name with the value it’s storing

book:
pages:


let book = "The Hobbit";
let pages = 310;
JS
Match the variable name with the data type it’s storing

book:
pages:


Humans use code to give instructions to computers, but the code will also be read by other human coders (or future you!)

Which name is better for a variable that stores account balance?

city
balance

Computer programs can store information like the user’s progress in a videogame with…

adaptors
connectors
variables

Create a new variable named credit

 credit 
 850;

 Lesson Takeaways
Amazing job! You learned that:

 

⭐ Data comes in different type

⭐ A string is piece of text data

⭐ Numbers should not be surrounded by quotation marks

⭐ Programs use variables to remember important information

⭐ A variable has a name and a value

In the next lesson, you’ll start working with information that has been stored in variables.
